  "response": "To find the area of the triangle with vertices A(1, 1), B(6, 1), and C(3, 7), we can use the formula for the area of a triangle given its vertices:\n\nArea = (1/2) * |x1(y2 - y3) + x2(y3 - y1) + x3(y1 - y2)|\n\nwhere (x1, y1), (x2, y2), and (x3, y3) are the coordinates of the vertices.\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nArea = (1/2) * |1(1 - 7) + 6(7 - 1) + 3(1 - 1)|\n\n= (1/2) * |1(-6) + 6(6) + 3(0)|\n\n= (1/2) * |-6 + 36 + 0|\n\n= (1/2) * 30\n\n= 15\n\nTherefore, the area of the triangle is 15 square units.",
