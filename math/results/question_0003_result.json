  "response": "To find the ratio of the shorter length to the longer length, we need to analyze the properties of a regular hexagon and its diagonals.\n\nA regular hexagon can be divided into 6 equilateral triangles by drawing lines from each vertex to the center of the hexagon. The shorter diagonal is equal to twice the altitude of one of these equilateral triangles, while the longer diagonal is equal to twice the side length of the triangle.\n\nSince the altitude of an equilateral triangle bisects it into two congruent right-angled triangles with angles 30°, 60°, and 90°, we can use trigonometric ratios to find the ratio of the shorter diagonal to the longer diagonal.\n\nLet's denote the side length of the hexagon as 's'. Then, the altitude of an equilateral triangle is s√3/2 (since it is opposite the 60° angle).\n\nThe shorter diagonal is twice this value: 2(s√3/2) = √3s\n\nThe longer diagonal is twice the side length: 2s\n\nNow, we can find the ratio of the shorter length to the longer length:\n\nRatio = Shorter Diagonal / Longer Diagonal\n= √3s / 2s\n= √3/2\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the shorter length to the longer length in a regular hexagon is √3/2.",
