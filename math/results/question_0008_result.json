  "question_text": "A right, rectangular prism has three faces with areas of $6,8$ and $12$ square inches. What is the volume of the prism, in cubic inches?",
  "response": "Let's call the dimensions of the rectangular prism \\(a\\), \\(b\\) and \\(c\\). We're given that the three faces have areas of 6, 8 and 12 square inches.\n\nThe area of a face can be calculated by multiplying two sides. Therefore, we can write the following equations:\n\n\\(ab = 6\\)\n\\(ac = 8\\)\n\\(bc = 12\\)\n\nTo find the volume of the rectangular prism, which is \\(V=abc\\), we need to multiply these three equations together.\n\nMultiplying the three equations gives us:\n\n\\(a^2b^2c^2 = 576\\)\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get:\n\n\\(abc = \\sqrt{576} = 24\\)\n\nTherefore, the volume of the prism is \\(V=24\\) cubic inches.",
