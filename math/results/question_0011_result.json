  "question_text": "A regular polygon has an exterior angle that measures $15$ degrees. How many sides does the polygon have?",
  "response": "The sum of the exterior angles of any polygon is always $360^\\circ$. Since all exterior angles are equal in a regular polygon, we can set up an equation to solve for the number of sides:\n\n$$n \\times 15 = 360,$$\n\nwhere $n$ represents the number of sides. We divide both sides by $15$, giving us\n\n$$n=\\frac{360}{15}=24.$$ \n\nThe final answer is 24.",
