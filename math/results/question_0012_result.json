  "response": "To find the probability that a randomly chosen point in the parallelogram is below the x-axis, we need to determine what portion of the parallelogram lies below the x-axis and compare it to the total area of the parallelogram.\n\nThe vertices of the parallelogram are A(3, 3), B(-3, -3), C(-9, -3), and D(-3, 3). \n\nFirst, we need to find the base and height of the parallelogram. The length of one side of the parallelogram (AB) is given by:\n\nAB = sqrt((3-(-3))^2 + (3-(-3))^2)\n= sqrt(6^2+6^2)\n= sqrt(72)\n\nThe height of the parallelogram can be found as:\nHeight = 6\n\nNow we have to calculate the area of the parallelogram. Area = base × height\nArea = 6√2 \nSince the x-axis is at y = 0, points with coordinates (x, -3) and (-9, -3) lie below the x-axis.\n\nThis forms a rectangle below the x-axis with length 6 units and width 12 units. The area of this rectangle is:\nArea_rectangle = Length × Width\n= 6 * 12\n= 72\n\nSince the entire parallelogram has an area of 6√2, we can now determine the probability that a randomly chosen point from the parallelogram will not be above the x-axis:\n\nProbability = (Area_rectangle / Area_parallelogram)\n= (72/6√2)\n= 36/3√2\n= 12/√2 \n\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\n= 12√2 / 2 \n= 6√2",
