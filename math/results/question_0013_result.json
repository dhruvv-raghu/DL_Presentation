  "question_text": "$B$ and $C$ trisect $\\overline{AD}$ and $M$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{AD}$. $MC = 8$. How many units are in the length of $\\overline{AD}$?",
  "response": "Let us call the lengths that B and C divide AD into \"x\". Because they trisect it, this means that each segment must have a length of x. Since M is the midpoint, the total length must be 3 times the number of divisions.\n\nSo the equation would be:\n2x = 16\nx = 8\n\nAD = 3 * 8 = 24 units",
