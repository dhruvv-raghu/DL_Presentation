  "response": "Let's call the side length of the equilateral triangle $s$. The formula for the area of an equilateral triangle is:\n\n$$\\text{Area} = \\frac{s^2 \\sqrt{3}}{4}$$\n\nSince we are told that the area is numerically equal to the length of one of its sides, we can set up an equation:\n\n$$\\frac{s^2 \\sqrt{3}}{4} = s$$\n\nTo solve for $s$, we can multiply both sides by 4 and then divide by $\\sqrt{3}$:\n\n$$s^2 = \\frac{4}{\\sqrt{3}}$$\n\nNow, we can take the square root of both sides to find $s$:\n\n$$s = \\sqrt{\\frac{4}{\\sqrt{3}}}$$\n\nTo simplify this expression, we can rationalize the denominator by multiplying both the numerator and denominator by $\\sqrt{3}$:\n\n$$s = \\sqrt{\\frac{4}{\\sqrt{3}} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{3}}}$$\n\n$$s = \\sqrt{\\frac{4\\sqrt{3}}{3}}$$\n\nFinally, we can simplify the expression under the radical sign by factoring out a perfect square:\n\n$$s = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} \\cdot \\sqrt[4]{3}$$\n\nNow that we have found $s$, we can find the perimeter of the triangle. The perimeter is equal to three times the length of one side, so we multiply $s$ by 3:\n\nPerimeter = $$3s = 3\\left(\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} \\cdot \\sqrt[4]{3}\\right)$$\n\nUsing the fact that $\\sqrt[4]{3}=\\sqrt{\\sqrt{3}}$, we can simplify this to:\n\nPerimeter = $$3\\left(\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} \\cdot (\\sqrt{3})^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\right)$$\n\nFinally, applying exponent rule 7 and distributing the multiplication, we get:\n\nPerimeter = $\\boxed{\\left(6\\sqrt{3}\\right)}$",
