  "response": "To compute $\\sin 45^\\circ$, we can use the definition of sine as the ratio of the opposite side to the hypotenuse in a right triangle.\n\nLet's consider a right triangle with an angle of $45^\\circ$ and legs of equal length. Since the triangle is isosceles, we can let each leg be of length 1 unit.\n\nThe hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) will have a length that satisfies the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n$$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$\n\nwhere $a$ and $b$ are the lengths of the legs, and $c$ is the length of the hypotenuse.\n\nSince we know that each leg has a length of 1 unit, we have:\n\n$$1^2 + 1^2 = c^2$$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$$2 = c^2$$\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we find that $c = \\sqrt{",
