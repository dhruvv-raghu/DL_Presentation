  "response": "The formula for the area of a triangle given its vertices (x1, y1), (x2, y2), and (x3, y3) is:\n\nArea = |(x1(y2 - y3) + x2(y3 - y1) + x3(y1 - y2)) / 2|\n\nPlugging in the values given in the problem:\n\nx1 = 0\ny1 = 0\nx2 = 0\ny2 = 5\nx3 = 7\ny3 = 12\n\nArea = |(0(5 - 12) + 0(12 - 0) + 7(0 - 5)) / 2|\n= |(0(-7) + 0(12) + 7(-5)) / 2|\n= |(-35) / 2|\n\nArea = |-17.5| \n\nThe absolute value of the result is used to ensure that the area is always positive.\n\nTherefore, the area of the triangle is approximately 17.5 square units.",
