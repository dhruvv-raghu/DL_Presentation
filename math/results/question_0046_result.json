  "response": "To find the focus of the parabola, we need to rewrite the equation in vertex form.\n\nThe given equation is $y = -3x^2 - 6x.$\nWe can complete the square by adding and subtracting $(\\frac{-6}{2})^2=9$:\n\\begin{align*}\n& y=-3x^2-6x\\\\\n=& -(3x^2+6x)\\\\\n=& -(3(x^2+2x)+9-9)\\\\\n=& -3(x^2+2x+1)-3(-9)\\\\\n=& -3(x+1)^2+27.\n\\end{align*}\nTherefore, we can see that the vertex form of the parabola is $y=-3(x+1)^2+27$ and the focus is at $(h,k)=(−1,27).$\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{(−1,27)}$.",
