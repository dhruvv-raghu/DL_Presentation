  "question_text": "Let $a,$ $b,$ and $t$ be real numbers such that $a + b = t.$  Find, in terms of $t,$ the minimum value of $a^2 + b^2.$",
  "response": "The expression we are minimizing is a sum of squares. Because the square function is increasing for positive inputs, the expression will attain its minimum value when all three variables are equal.\n\nIf $a + b = t$, then if $a=b=t/2,$ we have\n$a^2+b^2=(t/2)^2+(t/2)^2=\\frac{t^2}{2}.$\n\nThus, the minimum value of $a^2 + b^2$ is $\\boxed{\\frac{t^2}{2}}.$",
