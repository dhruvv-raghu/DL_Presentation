  "question_text": "The average of the numbers $1, 2, 3,\\dots, 98, 99,$ and $x$ is $100x$. What is $x$?",
  "response": "To find the value of x, we first need to calculate the sum of all the given numbers.\n\nLet's denote S as the sum:\nS = (1+2+3+...+98 +99) + x\n\nThe formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers is given by:\n\nn(n+1)/2\n\nUsing this formula, we get:\n\nS = 98(98+1)/2 + 99 + x\n= (98*99)/2 + 99 + x\n\nNow we need to find S and set up an equation.\n\nThe average of the numbers 1 through 99 and x is given by:\n(S/x) = 100x\n\nWe can now substitute the value of S into the equation:\n((98 * 99)/2 + 99 + x)/x = 100x\n\nNow we simplify the equation:\n(99*49)/2 + 99 = 100x^2\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:\n(99*49) + 198 = 200x^2\n= 2451 + 198 \n= 2649\n200x^2 = 2649 \n\nDivide by 200 on both sides:\nx^2 = 13.225\n\nNow we can find x using square root.\nSince the question specifies that there is a single solution for x, and it's given as 100x, this means the value of x must be positive because if x were negative, then the average would be negative, which is not possible here.\n\nTaking the square root of both sides:\nx = âˆš(13.225)\n= 3.65 \n\nTherefore, the solution for x is approximately equal to 3.65",
