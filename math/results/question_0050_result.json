  "response": "To find the quotient, we can use synthetic division. \n\nFirst, we write down the coefficients of the dividend (the polynomial being divided) and the root of the divisor (in this case, -1):\n\n```\nx   | 1   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 7\n-1 |\n```\n\nThen, we multiply the first coefficient by the root (-1), add it to the second coefficient (0), and write down the result:\n\n```\nx   | 1   | -1   | 1   | 0   | 7\n-1 |\n```\n\nNext, we multiply the second result by the root (-1) and add it to the third coefficient (0), and write down the new result:\n\n```\nx   | 1   | -1   | -1   | 1   | 7\n-1 |\n```\n\nWe continue this process with the next coefficients, multiplying each one by the current root (-1) and adding it to the subsequent coefficient. The final result is:\n\n```\nx   | 1   | -1   | -2   | 3   | 4\n-1 |\n```\n\nThe last value in the bottom row (in this case, 4) is the remainder of the division.\n\nThe numbers above each line represent the coefficients of the quotient polynomial. We read from left to right:\n\n$$x^4- x^3+ x^2- x + 4.$$\n\nTherefore, the quotient when $x^5 + 7$ is divided by $x + 1$ is $\\boxed{x^4-x^3+x^2-x+4}$.",
