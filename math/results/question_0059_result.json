  "response": "For the two functions to intersect at exactly one point, their equations should be equal:\n\n$$ax^2+3x+1=-x-1.$$\n\nMoving all terms to the left side of the equation yields\n\n\\begin{align*}\n& ax^2 + 4x +2 =0\n\\end{align*}\n\nThe discriminant $b^{2} - 4ac$ of a quadratic is equal to zero if and only if the parabola has exactly one root. This happens when $a=0$. So, $a=\\boxed{0}.$",
