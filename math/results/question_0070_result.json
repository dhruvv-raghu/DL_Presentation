  "question_text": "On the first day, Barry Sotter used his magic wand to make an object's length increase by $\\frac{1}{2}$, meaning that if the length of the object was originally $x,$ then it is now $x + \\frac{1}{2} x.$  On the second day he increased the object's longer length by $\\frac{1}{3}$; on the third day he increased the object's new length by $\\frac{1}{4}$; and so on. On the $n^{\\text{th}}$ day of performing this trick, Barry will make the object's length exactly 100 times its original length. What is the value of $n$?",
  "response": "On the first day the new length of the object was $\\frac52x$, where x was the length on that morning. On the second day the objectâ€™s length increased by \\(\\frac13\\), so it was \\(x+ \\frac 12x + \\frac13(x+\\frac 12x) = (\\frac53)x + (\\frac13)^2x\\). On the third day the object's new length increased by \\(\\frac14\\) so it became \\(x+ \\frac 12x + \\frac13(x+\\frac 12x)+\\frac14(x+(\\frac13)^2x)= (\\frac53)(x+\\frac13^2 x) + \\frac14x\\). In general, for the first $n$ days, the object's new length was\n\\begin{align*}\n& (x + \\frac12 x+ \\frac13(x+\\frac12x)+ \\cdots + (\\frac1{n+1})^{n-1}x) \\\\\n= & x + \\sum_{i = 0}^{n -2}\\left(\\frac1{i+3}\\right)^{i}(x+\\frac12\\cdot\\left(\\frac1(i+2)\\right)^{i-1}x)\n\\end{align*}\nTo solve this problem, we want to find the smallest value for which $x+n(x + \\sum_{i = 0}^{n -2}\\left(\\frac1{i+3}\\right)^{i}(x+\\frac12\\cdot\\left(\\frac1(i+2)\\right)^{i-1}x)=100x$.\nWe can simplify this expression by canceling $x$, giving:\n$$n + \\sum_{i = 0}^{n -2}\\left(\\frac1{i+3}\\right)^{i}(1 + \\frac12\\cdot\\left(\\frac1(i+2)\\right)^{i-1})=100$$\nThe summation can be simplified by finding the pattern in the sum. The expression $1+\\frac12\\left(\\frac1(i+2)\\right)$ is a telescoping series, and its value is \\(\\frac{i +3}{(i+2)}.\\)\nTherefore we have:\n$$n+\\sum_{i = 0}^{n -2}\\left(\\frac1{i+3}\\right)^{i}\\cdot\\frac{i +3}{i+2}=100$$\nWe can factor out $\\frac{n(n-1)(n-2)\\cdots(0)}{(n-2)!}$ from the sum:\n$$(n)+\\sum_{i = 0}^{n -2}\\left(\\frac{\\frac1(i+3)}{i +2}\\right)^{i}=100$$\nLet $a_i = \\frac{i}{i+3}$. We can simplify this as follows:\n$$(n) + \\sum_{i=0}^{\\infty} (a_ia_{i+1})(\\cdots)(a_n a_{n+1}) = 100.$$\nNote that if the final result were a telescoping sum, the expression would simply be $a_{n+1}$.\nHowever since this isn't a simple telescoping sum, we can instead simplify it by expanding $(a_ia_{i+1})(\\cdots)(a_n a_{n+1})$:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& (a_ia_{i+1})=(\\frac{i}{i+3}) \\cdot (\\frac{i+1}{(i+1)+3}) \\\\\n& =(\\frac{i(i+1)}{(i+1)+3}) \\\\\n&=\\left(\\frac{i(i+1)}{i +4}\\right)\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTherefore $(a_ia_{i+1})(\\cdots)(a_n a_{n+1})$ is equal to $$\\left( \\frac{i^2+i}{i+4} \\right)\\left(\\frac{i+1}{i+5}\\right)\\cdots\\left(\\frac{i+n-1}{i+n+1}\\right)$$\nWe can also rewrite $(a_ia_{i+1})(\\cdots)(a_n a_{n+1})$ as the product of $$(a_i \\cdot a_{i+1} \\cdot \\dotsm \\cdot a_{i+n-1}) = \\left(\\frac{i}{i+3}\\right)\\left(\\frac{i+1}{i+4}\\right) \\cdots\\left(\\frac{i+n-2}{i+n-1}\\right).$$\nWe can factor out the first fraction of each term in this product:\n$$(a_i)(a_{i+1}) = (a_i)=\\left(\\frac{i}{i+3}\\right)\\cdot\\left(\\frac{(i+4)}{i+5} \\right)$$\nUsing this, we can rewrite $(a_ia_{i+1})(\\cdots)(a_n a_{n+1})$ as the product of $$(a_i)=\\left(\\frac{i}{i+3}\\right)\\cdot\\left(\\frac{(i+4)}{i+5} \\right)$$\nIf we multiply each term in this expression by $(a_i)$, we get:\n$$(a_ia_{i+1})(\\cdots)(a_n a_{n+1}) = (a_i)(a_{i+1}) \\cdot\\left(\\frac{i}{i+3}\\right)\\cdot\\left(\\frac{(i+4)}{i+5} \\right)$$\n$$(a_ia_{i+1})(\\cdots)(a_n a_{n+1}) = (a_i)(a_{i+1}) \\cdot\\left(\\frac{i}{i+3}\\right)\\cdot\\left(\\frac{(i+4)}{i+5} \\right)$$\nIf we continue to multiply by $a_i$:\n$$(a_ia_{i+1})(\\cdots)(a_n a_{n+1}) = (a_i)^2(a_{i+1}) \\cdot\\left(\\frac{i}{i+3}\\right)\\cdot\\left(\\frac{(i+4)}{i+5} \\right)$$\nWe can continue to do this, and after n terms we get:\n$$(a_ia_{i+1})(\\cdots)(a_n a_{n+1}) = (a_i)^n(a_{n+1}).$$",
