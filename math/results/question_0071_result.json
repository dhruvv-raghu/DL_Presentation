  "question_text": "For each positive integer $n$, the mean of the first $n$ terms of a sequence is $n$. What is the 2008th term of the sequence?",
  "response": "The sum of the first n terms of the sequence can be represented as follows:\n\nS(n) = (1 + x)(2 + x)...(n + x)\n\nUsing algebra, we can simplify this expression to get the following equation for S(n):\n\nS(n) = n * ((n+1)/2) + n * x\n\nWe are given that S(n) / n is always equal to n, so we have:\n\nx = (n + 1)/2 - x\n\nor\n\n2x = n + 1/2\n\nx = (n + 1)/2\n\nNow we can substitute this expression for x into the equation for S(n):\n\nS(n) = n * ((n+1)/2) + n * ((n+1)/2)\n\nSimplifying this gives:\n\nS(n) = n^2 + n/2\n\nSince we know that S(2008) is 2008 * (2009/2), which equals 2010,2016, we can subtract the sum of the first 2007 terms from it to get our final answer.\n\nThe sum of the first 2007 terms can be calculated in a similar way as before:\n\nS(2007) = 2007^2 + 2007/2\n\nSubtracting this from S(2008), we obtain:\n\nS(2008)-S(2007)=n+1/2=n-2010\n\nThe 2008th term is therefore equal to - 2010.\n\nSo the final answer is $\\boxed{-2010}$.",
