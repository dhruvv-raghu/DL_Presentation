  "question_text": "A day can be evenly divided into 86,400 periods of 1 second; 43,200 periods of each 2 seconds; or in many other ways. In total, how many ways are there to divide a day into $n$ periods of $m$ seconds, where $n$ and $m$ are positive integers?",
  "response": "A day can be divided into $86\\,400 = 60 \\cdot 40 \\cdot 9$ periods of $1$ second or into $43\\,200 = 30 \\cdot 20 \\cdot 12$ periods of $2$ seconds. Thus we have two cases to consider:\nCase one: the number of seconds is a factor of $86\\,400$. In this case, there are $7$ divisors, as $\\frac{60}{1} \\times \\frac{40}{1} \\times \\frac{9}{1} = 2160$ and we have the divisors $1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8$ (corresponding to the divisor $86\\,400/2160 = 40$).\nCase two: the number of seconds is a factor of $43\\,200$. In this case, there are $9$ divisors, as $\\frac{30}{1} \\times \\frac{20}{1} \\times \\frac{12}{1}=720$ and we have the divisors $1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10$.",
