  "question_text": "Josef and Timothy play a game in which Josef picks an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive and Timothy divides 1000 by that integer and states whether or not the quotient is an integer.  How many integers could Josef pick such that Timothy's quotient is an integer?",
  "response": "To find the number of integers that Josef could pick, we need to consider the factors of 1000.\n\nThe prime factorization of 1000 is: \n\n2^3 * 5^3\n\nNow, let's count the total number of divisors (factors) of 1000. We can do this using the formula for counting divisors based on prime factorization:\n\nFor a prime factorization p_1^{a_1} * p_2^{a_2} * ... * p_k^{a_k}, the number of divisors is given by: (a_1 + 1) * (a_2 + 1) * ... * (a_k + 1)\n\nIn this case, we have:\n\n(a_1 + 1) = (3 + 1) = 4\n(a_2 + 1) = (3 + 1) = 4\n\nSo, the total number of divisors is: 4 * 4 = 16\n\nTherefore, Josef could pick any one of these 16 integers such that Timothy's quotient would be an integer.",
