  "response": "## Step 1: To determine if the decimal representation of a fraction terminates, we need to check its denominator when reduced to lowest terms.\nThe fraction is n/475. We will find out how many values of n make this fraction have a terminating decimal.\n\n## Step 2: Factorize the denominator 475 into prime factors.\nPrime factorization of 475 is 5^2 * 19.\n\n## Step 3: Determine which values of n would lead to a terminating decimal for n/475.\nFor the decimal representation to terminate, the numerator n must have enough factors of primes (other than 2 and 5) in its prime factorization so that they cancel out the non-terminating factors in the denominator.\n\n## Step 4: Identify the prime factors other than 2 and 5 in the denominator.\nThe only prime factor other than 2 and 5 is 19. Therefore, n must be divisible by 19 to cancel out the non-terminating factor of 19.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate how many multiples of 19 are between 1 and 474 (inclusive).\nTo find this, we divide 474 by 19. The quotient part tells us how many numbers between 1 and 474 are divisible by 19, including 0. We then round down to the nearest whole number since we cannot include fractions as valid values for n.\n\n## Step 6: Perform the division of 474 by 19.\nThe quotient is approximately 24.947. Rounding down gives us a total of 24 numbers that are divisible by 19 between 1 and 474 inclusive.\n\n## Step 7: Consider if there's any additional number that would also make the fraction n/475 terminate, which could be achieved when n has factors of both 19 and another prime factor that cancels out in the denominator.\nHowever, as established earlier, this is already covered by counting multiples of 19 alone since other prime factors (like 5) don't affect whether a decimal terminates or not.\n\n## Step 8: Determine if any numbers between 1 and 474 are also divisible by higher powers of 19 to ensure the fraction reduces further.\nSince our only non-terminating factor is 19, we already accounted for terminating conditions by focusing on multiples of 19. Thus, there's no additional consideration needed.\n\n## Step 9: Finalize the calculation based on step 6.\nWe have determined that the number of values of n between 1 and 474 inclusive which make the decimal representation of n/475 terminate is equivalent to our count from step 6.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{24}$",
