  "question_text": "Fifty cards, numbered 1-50, are placed in a box. One card is randomly selected. What is the probability that the number on the card is prime and is a multiple of 7? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
  "response": "To find the probability that the number on the card is both prime and a multiple of 7, we need to consider the following:\n\n1. Prime numbers: A prime number is a positive integer greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. In this case, we're only interested in prime numbers between 1 and 50.\n\n2. Multiples of 7: A multiple of 7 is a number that can be divided by 7 without leaving a remainder. We need to find the multiples of 7 within the range of 1-50.\n\nNow, let's identify the prime numbers between 1 and 50:\n2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, and 47\n\nAmong these prime numbers, only one number is a multiple of 7: 7.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the number on the card is both prime and a multiple of 7 is:\n\nP(both) = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of possible outcomes\n= 1 (number 7) / 50 (total numbers)\n= 1/50\n\nSo, the probability that the number on the card is both prime and a multiple of 7 is 1/50.",
