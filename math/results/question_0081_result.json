  "response": "A nice problem!\n\nLet's analyze the situation:\n\nIn base 7, the number is $AB_7 = A \\cdot 7 + B$.\n\nIn base 5, the same number is $BA_5 = B \\cdot 5 + A$.\n\nSince both expressions represent the same positive integer, we can set them equal to each other:\n\n$$A \\cdot 7 + B = B \\cdot 5 + A$$\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n$$6A = 4B$$\n\nDividing both sides by 2, we get:\n\n$$3A = 2B$$\n\nNow, we need to find values of $A$ and $B$ that satisfy this equation.\n\nAfter some trial and error (or using a bit of logic), we can see that:\n\n$$A = 2 \\quad\\text{and}\\quad B = 3$$\n\nsatisfy the equation. Therefore, the positive integer in base 7 is $23_7$, and in base 5 is $32_5$.\n\nNow, let's convert these numbers to decimal:\n\nIn base 7: $23_7 = 2 \\cdot 7 + 3 = 17$\n\nIn base 5: $32_5 = 3 \\cdot 5 + 2 = 17$\n\nAnd indeed! The positive integer in decimal is $\\boxed{17}$.",
