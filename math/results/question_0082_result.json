  "response": "The expression (n + 18)/n can be rewritten as 1 + 18/n. This fraction will be an integer if and only if n is a factor of 18.\n\nThe factors of 18 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 18. The sum of these values is 1 + 2 + 3 + 6 + 9 + 18 = 39.\n\nTherefore, the sum of all positive integer values of n such that (n+18)/n is an integer is 39.",
