  "response": "## Step 1: Determine the possible units digits for powers of 21\nTo find the units digit of $n$, we first need to determine the pattern of the units digit when raising 21 to different powers. Since $21^6$ is being multiplied by both $m$ and $n$, understanding this pattern will help us deduce the possible units digits for $n$. Given that the units digit of $mn = 21^6$ is a crucial piece of information, we must analyze how raising 21 to different powers affects its units digit.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the units digit of $21^1$, $21^2$, and other higher powers\nThe units digit of any power of 21 will depend on the units digits of its factors. However, for the units digit, we only need to consider the units digits of 1 (which is always 1) and 21 (which has a units digit of 1). Since $21^1$ ends in 1, raising it to any power will also result in a number ending in 1. This pattern holds for higher powers as well.\n\n## Step 3: Find the units digits of powers of 21 up to $21^6$\nFollowing the established pattern that the units digit of any power of 21 is always 1, we can determine that the units digit of $21^6$ will also be 1. This means that the product of the units digits of $m$ and $n$ must end in 1.\n\n## Step 4: Use the information about $m$ to find possible units digits for $n$\nSince we know that $m$ has a units digit of 7, we can use this information to determine what units digit $n$ could have. We are looking for a number whose product with 7 results in a number ending in 1.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the possible units digit of $n$\nConsidering different numbers and their multiplication tables, we find that the only number which, when multiplied by 7, gives a result ending in 1 is 3. Therefore, the units digit of $n$ must be 3.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{3}$",
