  "response": "To find the number of positive integers less than 1000 that are congruent to 6 (mod 11), we need to find the number of integers in the form 11k + 6 that are less than 1000.\n\nFirst, we can set up an inequality to represent this:\n\n11k + 6 < 1000\n\nSubtracting 6 from both sides gives us:\n\n11k < 994\n\nDividing both sides by 11 gives us:\n\nk < 90.3636...\n\nSince k must be an integer, the largest possible value of k is 90.\n\nTherefore, the number of positive integers less than 1000 that are congruent to 6 (mod 11) is 90 + 1 = 91.\n\nSo, there are 91 positive integers less than 1000 that are congruent to 6 (mod 11).",
