  "response": "## Step 1: Recall the definition of the greatest common divisor (GCD)\nThe greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers is the largest positive integer that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder.\n\n## Step 2: Factorize the quadratic expression $a^2+9a+24$\nWe can factorize $a^2+9a+24$ into $(a+4)(a+5)+4$, using polynomial long division or synthetic division, although factoring seems not straightforward. However, recognizing that it's part of the Euclidean Algorithm for finding GCD, we move forward with the understanding that simplification through division will be key.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the Euclidean Algorithm to find the GCD\nGiven two numbers $m$ and $n$, where $m > n$, the Euclidean Algorithm states that $\\text{GCD}(m,n) = \\text{GCD}(n, m - kn)$ for some integer $k$. Applying this principle to our expression with $m = a^2 + 9a + 24$ and $n = a+4$, we can see that the GCD of these two expressions will be equivalent to finding $\\text{GCD}((a+4)(a+5)+4, (a+4))$. Since $(a+4)$ is a factor in both terms of our first expression after expansion and simplification, it leaves us with $4$ for the GCD calculation.\n\n## Step 4: Recognize that since $a$ is a multiple of 1428, it implies $a = 1428k$, where $k$ is an integer\nThis step acknowledges the relationship between $a$ and $1428$ but does not affect the GCD directly as we are looking for a constant divisor.\n\n## Step 5: Identify that the GCD depends solely on the remainder when dividing by $(a+4)$\nSince $a = 1428k$, then any factor of $(a+4)$ will also be a factor of $a$. However, since our goal is to find the greatest common divisor of $(a^2 + 9a + 24)$ and $(a + 4)$, we recognize that any additional common factors beyond what's already clear are unnecessary.\n\n## Step 6: Deduce the GCD from the simplified relationship\nFrom step 3, recognizing that $\\text{GCD}((a+4)(a+5)+4, (a+4)) = \\text{GCD}(4, a + 4)$ because $(a+4)$ is a factor in both terms of our first expression after expansion and simplification. Since $a$ is a multiple of 1428, we can see that regardless of the value of $k$, $(a+4)$ will always be divisible by 4.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4}$",
