  "question_text": "Given that $n$ is a positive integer, and given that $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[24,n]=72$ and $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[n,27]=108$, what is $n$?",
  "response": "Let's break down the information we have:\n\n1. $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[24,n]=72$\n\nThis implies that 72 is a multiple of both 24 and n.\n\n2. $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[n,27]=108$\n\nSimilarly, 108 is a multiple of both n and 27.\n\nNow, we know that the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers is always greater than or equal to their greatest common divisor (GCD). So, if we can find any number that divides both 72 and 108, it must also divide $n$.\n\nThe prime factorizations are:\n\n- 72 = 2^3 * 3^2\n- 108 = 2^2 * 3^3\n\nAny divisor of 72 or 108 must be a combination of the powers of 2 and 3 that appear in either prime factorization. The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 72 and 108 can be found by taking the minimum exponent for each shared prime factor.\n\n- GCD(72, 108) = 2^2 * 3 = 12\n\nThis means that n must also have a multiple of 12 as one of its divisors. Now we need to check which values satisfy both conditions:\n\na) LCM(24, n)=72\nb) LCM(n, 27) = 108\n\nWe can quickly see that if n is a multiple of 12 but not of any higher power of 2 and/or higher power of 3 than it occurs in the factorization of 108 (to keep both conditions true), then:\n\nn=12 satisfies the conditions: \nLCM(24, 12) = 24\nLCM(12, 27)=54\nHowever n=12 does not satisfy LCM(n,27)=108\n\nWe can test larger multiples of 12 to see if any other values work.\n\nIf we multiply n by 9, it will be 108, which is the desired value for LCM(n,27). But multiplying by 9 also means that  n=12 does not satisfy LCM(24,n)=72\n\nHowever, since both conditions need to be satisfied simultaneously and if we test values larger than 108 then they won't divide into both numbers. So n should satisfy: \n\nLCM(24,n)=72\nLCM(n,27) = 108 \n\nWe see that any integer multiple of 12 will do for the first condition, but an integer multiple of 9 does for the second.\n\nTherefore we need to find a value between $n=12$ and $n=108$ which is divisible by both 12 and 9. Therefore n must be equal to:\n\nn = 12*9 / gcd(12,9)\n\nWe know that GCD (12, 9) is 3.\n\nSo n=12 * 9 / 3 \n\nwhich simplifies to\n\nn = 36",
