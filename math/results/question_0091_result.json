  "response": "The sum of the first n natural numbers is given by the formula:\n\n$$\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$$\n\nIn this case, we want to find the remainder when $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + \\dots + 9 + 10$ is divided by 8. We can use the formula to find the sum:\n\n$$\\frac{10(10+1)}{2} = \\frac{10(11)}{2} = 55$$\n\nNow, we want to find the remainder when 55 is divided by 8. To do this, we can divide 55 by 8 and take the remainder:\n\n$$55 \\div 8 = 6 \\text{ with a remainder of } 7$$\n\nTherefore, the remainder when $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + \\dots + 9 + 10$ is divided by 8 is 7.",
