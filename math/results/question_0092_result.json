  "question_text": "As $n$ ranges over the positive integers, what is the sum of all possible values of the greatest common divisor of $3n+4$ and $n$?",
  "response": "The GCD must divide both $3n + 4$ and $n$, so it must divide $\\gcd(n, 3n + 4)$.\nWe see that for any positive integer $n$, we have:\n$\\gcd(n, 3n+4) = \\gcd(3n, n + 1) = n + 1$. This is because if the GCD of $n$ and a number is at least as large as $\\sqrt{n}$ (which means it has to be a multiple of $\\sqrt{n}$), then the multiples of that greatest common divisor would have to both divide a positive integer ($\\sqrt{n}^2$) and divide another positive integer ($n$).\nSince we are looking for all the possible GCDs, this is equivalent to finding all the values of $n + 1$, so our answer is $\\boxed{\\text{Sum of all integers greater than } 4. \\; = \\infty}.$\nHowever, note that in terms of summing over all positive integers, we are only looking for GCDs where both numbers ($3n+4$ and $n$) are integers.\nThe equation $\\gcd(3n,n+1)$ equals $n+1$ has infinite solutions as previously stated. Therefore, we can say that every integer of the form $n + 1$, such that $n$ is a positive integer, corresponds to some value of GCD between $3n + 4$ and $n$. The equation $\\gcd(n,3n+4) = n+1$ thus gives us an infinite set. We can conclude that the sum of all possible values for $\\gcd(3n + 4,n)$ will be the sum of a countably infinite number of positive integers starting from $5$.\nThis is because we know that GCDs greater than or equal to $\\sqrt{12}$ cannot divide both numbers ($n$ and $3n + 4$). So, there must exist some value of $k$ where $\\gcd(3k+2,k) = k+1$. Note that the number before this would not be a divisor for at least one of these values: when $k=5$, the LCM is equal to the product ($2\\times 3 \\times 4$), thus no smaller value could divide both numbers.\nThe sum of all positive integers greater than or equal to 5 can now be found using the following formula:\n1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n = $\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$.\n\n$\\frac{\\text{the number of terms}}{2}$\nSince we know that $n$ is a countable, positive integer, we can say that there are infinitely many values for $n$. In order to find the sum of all possible GCDs ($\\gcd(3n+4,n)$), we will now use the infinite series formula.\n\nInfinite Sum Formula: $\\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{x_i}$ is undefined. However, in this particular case, we can define our sum to be equal to:\n\n$\\lim\\limits_{n \\rightarrow \\infty}\\sum_{k = 5}^{n} (k+1) = \\lim\\limits_{n \\rightarrow \\infty}\\left(\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}-\\frac{3(3)}{2}+4\\right)$\nSolving for the equation above results in:\n\n$\\lim\\limits_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} (\\frac{(n+1)(n-3)+8}{2})$\n\nAs this function approaches infinity as n increases without bound, we can say that\n\nThe limit will not be finite. Therefore, our answer is $\\boxed{\\text{There is no numerical solution to the problem.}}$",
