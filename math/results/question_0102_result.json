  "question_text": "The base-10 numbers 217 and 45 are multiplied. The product is then written in base-6. What is the units digit of the base-6 representation?",
  "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the product of 217 and 45, and then convert that product to base-6.\n\nFirst, let's multiply 217 and 45:\n\n217 × 45 = 9765\n\nNow, we need to convert 9765 to base-6. To do this, we can repeatedly divide by 6 and keep track of the remainders.\n\n9765 ÷ 6 = 1628 remainder 3\n1628 ÷ 6 = 272 remainder 2\n272 ÷ 6 = 45 remainder 2\n45 ÷ 6 = 7 remainder 3\n7 ÷ 6 = 1 remainder 1\n1 ÷ 6 = 0 remainder 1\n\nNow, we read the remainders from bottom to top: 123232. So the base-6 representation of 9765 is 123232.\n\nThe units digit of this number is 2.",
