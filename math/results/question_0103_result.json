  "response": "To find the remainder when $5^{137}$ is divided by 8, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Compute the powers of 5 modulo 8: \n\n$5^1 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{8}$\n$5^2 \\equiv 25 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{8}$\n$5^3 \\equiv 5\\cdot 1 = 5 \\pmod{8}$\n\nNotice that the powers of $5^2$ are all congruent to $1$ modulo $8$. Therefore, we can write:\n\n$5^{137} = (5^2)^{68}\\cdot 5$\n\nSince $5^2\\equiv 1\\pmod 8$, we have:\n\n$(5^2)^{68}\\equiv 1^{68}\\equiv 1 \\pmod 8$\n\nNow, multiply both sides by $5$ to get:\n\n$5^{137} \\equiv 5\\cdot 1\\equiv 5 \\pmod 8$\n\nTherefore, the remainder when $5",
