  "question_text": "When we say that Ray is climbing up the stairs $m$ at a time, we mean that he starts on the floor (step $0$) then jumps to step $m$ and then to $2m$ and so on until the number of steps to the top is less than $m$. Ray climbs up a flight of stairs of $n$ steps in two ways. When he does it $4$ steps at a time, there are $3$ steps left at the top. When he does it $5$ steps at a time, there are $2$ steps left at the top. What is the smallest possible value of $n$ that is greater than $10$?",
  "response": "Let's call the number of steps up and down the stairs n.\n\nWe know that when Ray climbs 4 steps at a time, there are 3 steps left, so we can write an equation:\n\nn ≡ 3 (mod 4)\n\nThis means that n is congruent to 3 modulo 4, which implies that n = 4k + 3 for some integer k.\n\nWhen Ray climbs 5 steps at a time, there are 2 steps left, so we can write another equation:\n\nn ≡ 2 (mod 5)\n\nThis means that n is congruent to 2 modulo 5, which implies that n = 5j + 2 for some integer j.\n\nWe need to find the smallest possible value of n that is greater than 10. To do this, we can start by finding the first few values of n that satisfy each equation separately.\n\nFor the first equation, the values of n are: 3, 7, 11, 15, 19, ...\n\nFor the second equation, the values of n are: 2, 7, 12, 17, 22, ...\n\nWe can see that the smallest value of n that satisfies both equations is 7. However, this value is less than 10, so we need to continue looking for larger values of n.\n\nThe next value of n that satisfies the first equation is 11, but it does not satisfy the second equation. The next value of n that satisfies the first equation is 15, but it also does not satisfy the second equation.\n\nHowever, the next value of n that satisfies both equations is 17 + 20 = 37.\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible value of n that is greater than 10 is $\\boxed{37}$.",
