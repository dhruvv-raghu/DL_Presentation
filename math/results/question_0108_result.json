  "question_text": "Let $A$ be the product of the divisors of $42$. How many distinct prime factors does $A$ have?",
  "response": "The product of the divisors of a number is equal to the number raised to the power that is half the total number of divisors. Therefore, we need to find the number of divisors of $42$.\n\nFirst note that since $42=2\\cdot3\\cdot7$, it has $1+1+1=4$ positive divisors: $1$, $2$, $3$, and $6$. Since $A=42^{4/2}=42^2$, it must have the same prime factors as $42$, which are $2, 3$, and $7$. Therefore, $A$ has $\\boxed{3}$ distinct prime factors.",
