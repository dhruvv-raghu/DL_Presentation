  "response": "To express the product of $1001_2$ and $121_3$ in base 10, we need to convert both numbers to base 10 first.\n\n$1001_2 = 1 \\cdot 2^3 + 0 \\cdot 2^2 + 0 \\cdot 2^1 + 1 \\cdot 2^0 = 8 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 9$\n\n$121_3 = 1 \\cdot 3^2 + 2 \\cdot 3^1 + 1 \\cdot 3^0 = 9 + 6 + 1 = 16$\n\nNow that we have both numbers in base 10, we can multiply them:\n\n$9 \\cdot 16 = 144$\n\nTherefore, the product of $1001_2$ and $121_3$ is $144_{10}$",
