  "response": "## Step 1: Write down the given inequality\nThe inequality we are given is $\\frac{7}{9} > \\frac{x}{13}$.\n\n## Step 2: Multiply both sides of the inequality by 13 to isolate x\nMultiplying by 13, we get $13\\cdot \\frac{7}{9} > x$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the left-hand side of the inequality\nCalculating $13\\cdot \\frac{7}{9}$ gives $\\frac{91}{9}$.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the greatest integer less than $\\frac{91}{9}$\n$\\frac{91}{9}$ is approximately $10.111...$, so the greatest integer less than this value is $10$.\n\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{10}$",
