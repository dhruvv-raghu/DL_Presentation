  "question_text": "The four-digit numeral $3AA1$ is divisible by 9. What digit does $A$ represent?",
  "response": "Since the number $3AA1$ is divisible by 9, we can use the divisibility rule for 9 to find $A$. The divisibility rule states that a number is divisible by 9 if and only if the sum of its digits is also divisible by 9.\n\nSo let's write out the equation: $$3 + A + A + 1 \\equiv 0 (\\text{mod } 9)$$\n$$4 + 2A \\equiv 0 (\\text{mod } 9)$$\n\nNow, we want to find values of $A$ that make this congruence true.\n\nSince the only digit from $0-9$, when $A=3$ makes the equation divisible by 9,\nthe solution is $\\boxed{3}$.",
