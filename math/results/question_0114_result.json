  "question_text": "Christine must buy at least $45$ fluid ounces of milk at the store. The store only sells milk in $200$ milliliter bottles. If there are $33.8$ fluid ounces in $1$ liter, then what is the smallest number of bottles that Christine could buy?  (You may use a calculator on this problem.)",
  "response": "## Step 1: Convert the required amount from fluid ounces to liters\nWe know that there are 33.8 fluid ounces in 1 liter. So, we need to divide $45$ by $33.8$ to convert it into liters.\n\n## Step 2: Perform the conversion calculation\n$\\frac{45}{33.8} \\approx 1.331$\n\n## Step 3: Convert the bottle size from milliliters to liters\nWe know that there are 1000 milliliters in a liter. So, we need to divide $200$ by $1000$ to convert it into liters.\n\n## Step 4: Perform the conversion calculation for bottles\n$\\frac{200}{1000} = 0.2$\n\n## Step 5: Divide the required amount by the bottle size to get the minimum number of bottles needed\nWe will divide $1.331$ (required liters) by $0.2$ (bottle size in liters).\n\n## Step 6: Perform the division calculation\n$\\frac{1.331}{0.2} = 6.655$\n\n## Step 7: Since Christine can't buy a fraction of a bottle, round up to the nearest whole number.\nWe need to round $6.655$ up to the next integer.\n\n## Step 8: Perform the rounding calculation\n$6.655 \\approx 7$\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{7}$",
