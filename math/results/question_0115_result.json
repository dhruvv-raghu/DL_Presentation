  "question_text": "I have eleven books, of which I want to bring two to read on vacation. How many different pairs can I choose?",
  "response": "To calculate the number of different pairs you can choose from 11 books, we can use the combination formula:\n\nnCr = n! / ((n-r)! * r!)\n\nwhere:\n- n is the total number of items (in this case, 11 books)\n- r is the number of items to choose (in this case, 2 books)\n\nFor your problem, the calculation would be:\n\n11C2 = 11! / ((11-2)! * 2!)\n= 11! / (9! * 2!)\n= (11 Ã— 10) / 2\n= 55\n\nSo you can choose 55 different pairs of books to bring on vacation.",
