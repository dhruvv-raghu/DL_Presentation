  "question_text": "In the six-digit integer $3A6,\\!792$, what is the largest digit $A$ so that the six-digit integer will be divisible by 3?",
  "response": "The divisibility rule for 3 states that if the sum of the digits of a number is divisible by 3, then the number itself is also divisible by 3. For this problem we need to find the value of $A$ which when added with the other digits will be divisible by 3.\n\\begin{align*}\n3 + A + 6 + 7 + 9 + 2\n\\end{align*}\n\nWe can see that this sum is equal to \n\\begin{align*}\n27 + A\\\\\n\\implies 27+A \\equiv 0\\mod3\\\\\n\\implies A \\equiv 0 \\mod 3.\n\\end{align*}Thus, the largest digit $A$ which makes the six-digit integer divisible by 3 is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(9)}}$.",
