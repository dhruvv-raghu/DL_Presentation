  "response": "The arithmetic mean of two numbers is their sum divided by $2$. We can find the arithmetic mean of $\\frac{2}{5}$ and $\\frac{4}{7}$ by first finding their sum:\n\n$$\\left(\\frac{2}{5}+\\frac{4}{7}\\right)+\\frac{1}{49},$$\n\nwhere the additional fraction was added to convert the denominator into 35, which is both a multiple of 5 and 7. Since $\\frac{2}{5}=\\frac{14}{35}$, we have \n\n$$\\left(\\frac{14}{35}+\\frac{4}{7}\\right)+\\frac{1}{49} = \\frac{14}{35} + \\frac{20}{35} + \\frac{1}{49}, $$\n\nand since $\\frac{2}{5}$ and $\\frac{4}{7}$ have a common denominator of 35, we can rewrite the equation as \n\n$$\\left(\\frac{34}{35}\\right)+\\frac{1}{49}.$$ Now, let's find a common denominator for these fractions, which is $35\\times49=1750$. \n\n$$\\left(\\frac{34\\times49}{35\\times49}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1\\times35}{49\\times35}\\right)=\\frac{1686+35}{1750}=\\frac{1721}{1750},$$\n\nand so the sum of $\\frac{2}{5}$ and $\\frac{4}{7}$ is $\\frac{1721}{1750}$. Now we can find the arithmetic mean by dividing this sum by $2$:\n\n$$\\left(\\frac{\\frac{2}{5}+\\frac{4}{7}}{2}\\right)=\\frac{\\frac{1721}{1750}}{2},$$\n\nwhere $\\frac{2}{5}$ and $\\frac{4}{7}$ are added together, then this sum is divided by $2$. So we can cancel the division of the fractions with 2 as follows:\n\n$$\\left(\\frac{\\frac{2}{5}+\\frac{4}{7}}{2}\\right)=\\frac{\\frac{1721}{1750}}{2}=\\frac{1721}{1750\\times 2}= \\frac{861}{875}.$$\n\nSo the arithmetic mean of $\\frac{2}{5}$ and $\\frac{4}{7}$ is $\\frac{861}{875}$",
