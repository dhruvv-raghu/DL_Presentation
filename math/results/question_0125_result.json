  "question_text": "For a designer suit, Daniel must specify his waist size in centimeters. If there are $12$ inches in a foot and $30.5$ centimeters in a foot, then what size should Daniel specify, in centimeters, if his waist size in inches is $34$ inches?  (You may use a calculator on this problem; answer to the nearest tenth.)",
  "response": "The length of one foot is 12 inches and also 30.5 cm. We can set up an equation with x being Daniel's waist size in centimeters:\n\n12 * (x / 30.5) = 34 \n\nWe will now solve for x by first multiplying both sides of the equation by 30.5 to get:\n12 * x = 34 * 30.5\n12 * x = 1037\n\nNext, we will divide both sides of the equation by 12 to get:\nx = 1037 / 12 \nx = 86.58333333333 (Note that this answer is rounded to 6 decimal places.)\n\nWe can use a calculator and round x up or down to get an answer with one decimal place. Since Daniel's waist size in inches was given as 34, which is below 35, we know that his waist size will be lower than 37. So we will round down.\n\nSo, Daniel should specify his waist size at 86.6 cm.",
