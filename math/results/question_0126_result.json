  "response": "## Step 1: Find the prime factorization of both numbers, which are 8 and 6.\nFor 8, we can write it as $2^3$, because $8 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2$. For 6, its prime factors can be written as $2 \\times 3$, since $6 = 2 \\times 3$.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the least common multiple (LCM) of 8 and 6.\nThe LCM is calculated by taking the highest power of each prime number found in both factorizations. In this case, we have $2^3$ from 8 and $2^1 \\times 3^1$ from 6. Thus, LCM = $2^3 \\times 3^1 = 24$.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 8 and 6.\nThe GCD is calculated by taking the lowest power of each prime number found in both factorizations. Here, we have $2^1$ from both numbers since that's the only shared prime factor to the first power between them. Thus, GCD = $2^1 = 2$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the product of LCM and GCD.\nNow, multiply the LCM by the GCD. Product = LCM $\\times$ GCD = $24 \\times 2$.\n\n## Step 5: Perform the multiplication to find the numerical answer.\n$24 \\times 2 = 48$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{48}$",
