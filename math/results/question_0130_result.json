  "question_text": "What is the simplified value of the sum: $-1^{2004} + (-1)^{2005} + 1^{2006} -1^{2007}$?",
  "response": "To simplify this expression, we need to evaluate each term separately:\n\n1. $-1^{2004}$: The exponentiation comes before the negation, so $1^{2004}=1$. However, since there is a negative sign in front of it, we have $-(1)= -1$.\n\n2. $(-1)^{2005}$: Since 2005 is an odd number, $(-1)^{2005}=-1$.\n\n3. $1^{2006}$: The exponentiation comes before the negation, so $1^{2006}=1$. However, since there is no sign in front of it, we have $+1$.\n\n4. $-1^{2007}$: This term is identical to the first one in the expression, and thus also evaluates to $-1$.\n\nSo, the simplified value of the sum is:\n\n$$-1 + (-1) + 1 - 1 = \\boxed{-2}.$$",
