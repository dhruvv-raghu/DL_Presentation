  "response": "To find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 91 and 72, we can use the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n1. Start by dividing the larger number (91) by the smaller number (72):\n91 ÷ 72 = 1 remainder 19\n2. Next, divide the smaller number (72) by the remainder (19):\n72 ÷ 19 = 3 remainder 15\n3. Continue with the remainder:\n19 ÷ 15 = 1 remainder 4\n4. Again:\n15 ÷ 4 = 3 remainder 3\n5. And again:\n4 ÷ 3 = 1 remainder 1\n6. Finally:\n3 ÷ 1 = 3 remainder 0\n\nThe last non-zero remainder is the GCD, which in this case is 1.\n\nTherefore, the greatest common divisor of 91 and 72 is 1.",
