  "response": "To find the least common multiple (LCM) of 14 and 21, we need to first find the prime factors of each number.\n\nThe prime factorization of 14 is: 2 × 7\nThe prime factorization of 21 is: 3 × 7\n\nSince both numbers have a common prime factor of 7, we can multiply the remaining factors together:\n\nLCM = 2 × 3 × 7\n= 42\n\nTherefore, the least common multiple (LCM) of 14 and 21 is 42.",
