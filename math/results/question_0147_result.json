  "response": "To find the largest prime factor of 3328, we can start by dividing it by the smallest prime number, which is 2.\n\n3328 ÷ 2 = 1664\n1664 ÷ 2 = 832\n832 ÷ 2 = 416\n416 ÷ 2 = 208\n208 ÷ 2 = 104\n104 ÷ 2 = 52\n52 ÷ 2 = 26\n\nWe can stop here because 26 is no longer divisible by 2. Now, we need to find the largest prime factor of 26.\n\n26 ÷ 2 = 13 (since 13 is a prime number)\n\nTherefore, the largest prime factor of 3328 is 13.",
