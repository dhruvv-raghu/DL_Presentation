  "question_text": "Angie's class has 2 girls for every 3 boys. If there are 20 students in the class, how many girls are in Angie's class?",
  "response": "To solve this problem, we can start by using the ratio of girls to boys: 2:3. This means that for every 3 boys, there are 2 girls.\n\nSince there are 20 students in total, and we know that the ratio is 2:3, we can set up an equation based on this ratio:\n\nLet's say the number of boys is 3x (since it's a multiple of 3). Then, the number of girls would be 2x.\n\nWe know that the total number of students is 20. So, we can write the equation:\n\n3x + 2x = 20\n\nCombine like terms:\n5x = 20\n\nDivide both sides by 5:\nx = 4\n\nNow that we have x, we can find out how many girls there are in Angie's class.\n\nThe number of girls is 2x, which is equal to:\n\n2 * 4 = 8\n\nSo, there are 8 girls in Angie's class.",
