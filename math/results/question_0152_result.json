  "question_text": "Jar A has exactly four red buttons and eight blue buttons.  Carla then removes the same number of red buttons as blue buttons from Jar A and places them in an empty Jar B.  Jar A now has $\\frac{2}{3}$ of its original number of buttons.  If Carla were now to randomly choose a button from Jar A and a button from Jar B, what is the probability that the two chosen buttons will both be red?  Express your answer as a common fraction.",
  "response": "To find the probability of selecting two red buttons from different jars, we need to calculate the probabilities for each jar.\n\nJar A initially has 4 red buttons and 8 blue buttons, making a total of 12 buttons.\n\nWhen Carla removes the same number of red and blue buttons as Jar B receives, she will be left with $\\frac{2}{3}$ of her original amount. This means that $\\frac{1}{3}$ of her original amount went to Jar B.\n\nSince there are 4 red buttons initially, $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the initial amount is: $4\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) = \\frac{4}{3}$\n\nSince this number cannot be greater than the total number of buttons in jar A (12), we know that Carla removed an equal number of red and blue buttons.\n\nLet's say Carla removed x red buttons. Then she must have also removed x blue buttons.\n\nThe number of remaining red buttons is: 4 - x\nThe number of remaining blue buttons is: 8 - x\n\nWe can now set up the equation for Jar A:\n\n$$(4-x)+(8-x)=12\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)$$\nSolving the equation, we get:\n$$(4+x)+(8+x)=12\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)$$\n$$(x+12)\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)=16$$\n$x=4$\n\nSo Carla removed 4 red and blue buttons. The number of red buttons left in Jar A is $4-4 = 0$, so it is empty.\n\nSince the number of red buttons is now 0, the probability of choosing a red button from jar A is $\\frac{0}{12}=\\boxed{0}$\n\nSince there are no buttons left in jar A and Carla moved all her buttons to jar B, we don't need to calculate the probability for Jar B.",
