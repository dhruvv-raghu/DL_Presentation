  "question_text": "A particular convex polygon with seven sides has exactly one right angle. How many diagonals does this seven-sided polygon have?",
  "response": "The number of diagonals in an n-gon is given by the formula:\n\nn(n-3)/2\n\nIn this case, n = 7.\n\nPlugging in n = 7 into the formula gives us:\n\n7(7-3)/2\n= 7(4)\n= 28/2\n= 14\n\nSo, the polygon has 14 diagonals.",
