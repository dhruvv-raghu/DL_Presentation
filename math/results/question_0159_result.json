  "response": "We need to isolate x in order to find out what integers are solutions. We can start by subtracting 5 from both sides:\n\n$$5-4x > 17$$\n$$0 - 4x > 12$$\n$$-4x > 12$$\n\nNow, divide both sides by $-4$.\n\nSince we're dividing by a negative number, the inequality sign must be flipped:\n$$x < -3$$\n\nThe largest integer value of x that satisfies this inequality is $-4$.",
