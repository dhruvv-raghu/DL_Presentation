  "question_text": "What is the least common multiple of 12, 18 and 30?",
  "response": "To find the least common multiple (LCM) of 12, 18, and 30, we need to first find the prime factorization of each number:\n\n* 12 = 2^2 * 3\n* 18 = 2 * 3^2\n* 30 = 2 * 3 * 5\n\nTo find the LCM, we take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the numbers:\n\n* 2^2 (from 12)\n* 3^2 (from 18)\n* 5 (from 30)\n\nSo, the LCM is: 2^2 * 3^2 * 5 = 4 * 9 * 5 = 180\n\nTherefore, the least common multiple of 12, 18, and 30 is 180.",
