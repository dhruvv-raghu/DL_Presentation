  "question_text": "Bill is sent to a donut shop to purchase exactly six donuts. If the shop has four kinds of donuts and Bill is to get at least one of each kind, how many combinations will satisfy Bill's order requirements?",
  "response": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of \"stars and bars\" or the balls-and-urns method.\n\nSince Bill wants at least one of each kind of donut, let's first assign one donut to each kind:\n\nDonut A: 1\nDonut B: 1\nDonut C: 1\nDonut D: 1\n\nNow, we have 3 remaining donuts to distribute among the 4 kinds. We can think of these 3 remaining donuts as \"stars\" and the 4 kinds of donuts as \"bars\". We need to place 3 stars behind 4 bars to represent the distribution of the remaining 3 donuts.\n\nFor example, one possible combination is: **|*|**\n\nHere, we have 1 star (representing a second donut) in front of Donut B, and no stars in front of the other kinds. This combination satisfies Bill's order requirements.\n\nTo find the total number of combinations, we can use the \"stars and bars\" formula:\n\n4+3 = 7\n\nThere are 7 ways to arrange 3 stars and 4 bars:\n\n1. ***|*| (2 donuts in front of Donut A)\n2. **|***| (1 donut in front of Donut B)\n3. *|**** (1 donut in front of Donut C)\n4. |***|* (2 donuts in front of Donut D)\n5. ***||| (all 3 remaining donuts in front of one kind)\n\nHowever, this is not the only way to distribute the remaining 3 donuts. We also need to consider cases where two or more donuts are placed in front of the same kind.\n\nTo calculate these additional cases, we can use combinations:\n\nCase 1: Two donuts in front of one kind\nThere are C(4,2) = 6 ways to choose which kind gets two donuts. For each choice, there are C(3,1) = 3 ways to place the other star.\n\nTotal combinations for Case 1: 6 x 3 = 18\n\nCase 2: Two donuts in front of two kinds\nThere are C(4,2) = 6 ways to choose which two kinds get two donuts. For each choice, there are C(3,1) = 3 ways to place the other star.\n\nTotal combinations for Case 2: 6 x 3 = 18\n\nCase 3: Two donuts in front of three kinds\nThere are C(4,3) = 4 ways to choose which three kinds get two donuts. For each choice, there is only 1 way to place the other star.\n\nTotal combinations for Case 3: 4 x 1 = 4\n\nCase 4: Three donuts in front of one kind\nThere are C(4,1) = 4 ways to choose which kind gets three donuts. For each choice, there is only 1 way to place the stars.\n\nTotal combinations for Case 4: 4 x 1 = 4\n\nNow we add up all the cases:\n\n7 + 18 + 18 + 4 + 4 = 51\n\nTherefore, there are 51 possible combinations that satisfy Bill's order requirements.",
