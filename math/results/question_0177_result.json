  "question_text": "Andrew and John are both Beatles fans.  Their respective collections share nine of the same albums.  Andrew has seventeen albums in his collection.  Six albums are in John's collection, but not Andrew's.  How many albums are in either Andrew's or John's collection, but not both?",
  "response": "To find the number of albums that are only in one person's collection, let's first determine how many albums each person has in common and then subtract this from their total.\n\nAndrew and John share nine albums. \n\nAndrew has 17 albums in his collection. To find the number of albums that Andrew has not shared with John, we subtract the shared albums from his total:\n\n17 (total) - 9 (shared) = 8\n\nNow, let's consider John's collection. We know he has six albums that are not shared with Andrew.\n\nWe can also set up an equation to represent the information given about John's unshared albums:\n\n6 = x - y, where x is the total number of albums John has and y is the number of albums they have in common (which we already determined to be 9).\n\nTo find the total number of albums John has, we can add the shared albums to the unshared ones:\n\nx = 6 + 9\nx = 15\n\nNow that we know both collections' sizes, we can calculate the number of albums in either collection but not both by adding the albums unique to each person's collection:\n\nAlbums only in Andrew's collection: 8\nAlbums only in John's collection: 6\n\nTotal albums in either collection but not both = 8 + 6 = 14",
