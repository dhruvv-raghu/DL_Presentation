  "question_text": "A baseball league has nine teams. During the season, each of the nine teams plays exactly three games with each of the other teams. What is the total number of games played?",
  "response": "Each team plays against 8 other teams and plays 3 games against each of those teams, so that is 8 * 3 = 24 games per team.\n\nSince there are 9 teams in total, you would think the answer is 9 * 24 = 216. But we have to remember that when calculating this way, each game has been counted twice - once for each of the two teams playing it.\n\nTo correct for this double counting, we must divide by 2.\n\nSo 216 / 2 = 108\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 108 games played during the season.",
