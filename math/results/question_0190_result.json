  "response": "## Step 1: Identify the general form of the expansion\nThe given expression can be expanded using the binomial theorem, which states that for any non-negative integer n, \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} a^{n-k}b^k\\).\n\n## Step 2: Determine the general term of the expansion\nIn this case, \\(a = 6x\\) and \\(b = \\dfrac{1}{3x}\\), so the general term is given by \\(\\binom{6}{k}(6x)^{6-k}(\\dfrac{1}{3x})^k\\).\n\n## Step 3: Determine the condition for a constant term\nFor the term to be constant, the powers of x must cancel each other out. Therefore, we need \\(6 - k = k\\), which implies that \\(k = 3\\).\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the constant term using k=3\nSubstituting \\(k = 3\\) into the general term, we get \\(\\binom{6}{3}(6x)^{3}(\\dfrac{1}{3x})^3 = \\binom{6}{3}(216x^3)(\\dfrac{1}{27x^3}) = \\binom{6}{3} \\cdot 8\\).\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the binomial coefficient\nThe binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) is defined as \\(\\dfrac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\\). In this case, \\(\\binom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).\n\n## Step 6: Multiply the binomial coefficient with the constant term\nSo, the constant term is \\(20 \\cdot 8 = 160\\).\n\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{160}$",
