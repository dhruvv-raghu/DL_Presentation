  "response": "The last two digits of the sum of factorials of the first 100 positive integers can be found by calculating the factorial of each number from 1 to 10, and then adding them up.\n\nHere is a Python code snippet that calculates this:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_factorial_sum():\n    total = 0\n    for i in range(1, 11):\n        # Calculate the factorial of the current number using memoization\n        factorial = [1]\n        for j in range(1, i + 1):\n            factorial.append(factorial[-1] * j)\n        \n        # Get the last two digits of the factorial\n        last_two_digits = factorial[i] % 100\n        \n        # Add the last two digits to the total sum\n        total += last_two_digits\n\n    return total % 100\n\nprint(calculate_factorial_sum())\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, it will print the last two digits of the sum of factorials of the first 10 positive integers.\n\nThis is because for any number n greater than 10, its factorial ends in",
