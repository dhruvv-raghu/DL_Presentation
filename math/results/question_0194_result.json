  "question_text": "How many different positive integers can be represented as a difference of two distinct members of the set $\\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots, 14, 15, 16 \\}?$",
  "response": "The greatest difference that we can obtain is $16-1=15$. The least possible difference is $2-1=1$.\n\nNote that we cannot have a difference of 0 since the numbers in the set are distinct.  So all integers from 1 to 15 will be represented by the differences, so the answer is $\\boxed{15}$.\nWe can also prove this with casework on how many integers are used to make the difference.\nThe number must be at least $16-7=9$ since we need the first term to be as small as possible.  It cannot be greater than $16-1=15$, so it is in $\\{9,10,\\ldots,15\\}$.\nCase one: If there are two numbers used then they must be $x,x+9$. The maximum number that can be represented by this difference is $15$ since the smallest possible number we could use would have to be 16.  Thus our answer is $\\boxed{7}$\nCase two: If there are three integers in a row and we let the first of these be $x$, then we know that $9\\le x+10\\le 18$. It follows that $-1 \\le (x+10)-(x+19) = -9$, so the only number we can represent is $\\boxed{0}$.\nCase three: If there are four numbers, and we let them be $x,x+9,x+18,x+27$, then we know that $3\\le x+18\\le 30$ or $-12\\le (x+18)-(x+45)=-27$, so our answer is $\\boxed{0}$.\nSince the number cannot be less than 1, nor greater than 15, it follows that the only possibilities for the value of the difference are $\\boxed{\\{9,10,\\ldots,15\\}}$",
