  "question_text": "When a certain biased coin is flipped five times, the probability of getting heads exactly once is not equal to $0$ and is the same as that of getting heads exactly twice. Let $\\frac ij$, in lowest terms, be the probability that the coin comes up heads in exactly $3$ out of $5$ flips. Find $i+j$.",
  "response": "## Step 1: Define the problem\nWe need to find the probability of getting exactly 3 heads out of 5 flips using a biased coin. The given information states that the probability of getting heads exactly once is the same as getting heads exactly twice.\n\n## Step 2: Set up equations for probabilities\nLet's denote the probability of getting heads on a single flip as $h$ and the probability of getting tails as $t$. Given that there are only two outcomes, we know that $h + t = 1$. The problem gives us information about the probabilities of getting exactly one head and exactly two heads.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the probability of getting exactly one head\nThe number of ways to get exactly one head in 5 flips is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{5}{1}$. Therefore, the probability of getting exactly one head is $\\binom{5}{1}h(1-h)^4$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the probability of getting exactly two heads\nSimilarly, the number of ways to get exactly two heads in 5 flips is given by $\\binom{5}{2}$. Therefore, the probability of getting exactly two heads is $\\binom{5}{2}h^2(1-h)^3$.\n\n## Step 5: Equate the probabilities\nSince we are told that these two probabilities are equal, we can set them up as an equation and solve for $h$: $$\\binom{5}{1}h(1-h)^4 = \\binom{5}{2}h^2(1-h)^3.$$ We can simplify this to: $$5h(1-h) = 10h^2(1-h).$$\n\n## Step 6: Solve the equation\nNow we need to solve for $h$. Dividing both sides by $5h$ (assuming $h \\neq 0$), we get $(1 - h) = 2h(1-h)$, which can be further simplified to $2h^2 - h + 1 = 0.$ Using the quadratic formula and considering that $h$ cannot be equal to 1 because then it wouldn't be a valid probability for flipping a coin, we find that $h=\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the probability of getting exactly three heads\nUsing the binomial distribution formula with $\\binom{5}{3}(\\frac{1}{3})^3(1-\\frac{1}{3})^{2}=10\\left(\\frac{1}{27}\\right)\\left(\\frac{4}{9}\\right)=\\frac{40}{243}$.\n\n## Step 8: Find the final answer\nWe have found that the probability of getting heads exactly three times in five flips is $\\frac{40}{243}$. So $i=40$ and $j=243$, which means the sum of i and j is 283.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{283}$",
