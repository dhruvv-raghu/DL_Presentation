  "response": "To find the probability that out of two students chosen at random, one student will be absent while the other is present, we need to consider all possible combinations.\n\nLet's assume Student A is the first student and Student B is the second student. There are three possible scenarios:\n\n1. Both students are absent: The probability of this occurring is (1/30) × (1/30) = 1/900.\n2. One student is absent, one student is present: There are two ways this can happen - either Student A is absent and Student B is present, or vice versa. Since the events are independent, we multiply by 2:\nThe probability of Student A being absent and Student B being present is (1/30) × (29/30).\nSimilarly, the probability of Student B being absent and Student A being present is also (1/30) × (29/30). So, in total, this scenario has a probability of 2 × (1/30) × (29/30) = 58/900.\n3. Both students are present: The probability of this occurring is (29/",
