  "response": "The total number of outcomes for rolling six dice is $6^6$ since each die has 6 possible outcomes.\n\nTo get six distinct numbers, we need to choose 6 out of the 6 possible numbers on each die. This can be done in $\\binom{6}{6} = 1$ way.\n\nTherefore, the probability of getting six distinct numbers is:\n\n$$\\frac{\\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\\text{Total number of outcomes}} = \\frac{1}{6^6} = \\frac{1}{46656}.$$\n\nSo, the probability of rolling six standard, six-sided dice and getting six distinct numbers is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{46656}}$.",
