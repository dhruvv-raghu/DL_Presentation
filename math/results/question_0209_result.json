  "question_text": "In a certain colony of bacteria, the number of bacteria doubles every day. The colony starts with 3 bacteria, and has 6 at the end of day 1, 12 at the end of day 2, and so on. What is the number of the first day which ends with the colony having more than 100 bacteria?",
  "response": "To solve this problem, we can use exponential growth to model the population of bacteria.\n\nSince the population doubles every day, we can express the population at the end of each day as:\n\nDay 0: 3\nDay 1: 2 × 3 = 6\nDay 2: 2 × 6 = 12\nDay 3: 2 × 12 = 24\n...\n\nWe can see that the population doubles every day, so we can use exponential growth to model it. \n\nThe general formula for exponential growth is:\n\nN(t) = N0 \\* (2)^t\n\nwhere:\n- N(t) is the number of bacteria at time t (in days)\n- N0 is the initial number of bacteria (3 in this case)\n- 2 is the growth factor (since the population doubles every day)\n\nWe want to find the first day when the population exceeds 100. \n\nLet's calculate the population for each day:\n\nDay 0: 3\nDay 1: 6\nDay 2: 12\nDay 3: 24\nDay 4: 48\nDay 5: 96\nDay 6: 192\n\nWe can see that on Day 6, the colony has more than 100 bacteria.\n\nTherefore, the first day which ends with the colony having more than 100 bacteria is Day 6.",
