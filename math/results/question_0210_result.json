  "question_text": "Both roots of the quadratic equation $x^2 - 63 x + k = 0$ are prime numbers. How many possible values of $k$ are there?",
  "response": "We first know that both the sum and product of the two primes $p_1$ and $p_2$, are equal to $63$ and $k$. This is because for a quadratic equation in the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, the roots can be expressed by the equation $\\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}.$ In this case, since we know the value of b and a, it is possible to write an expression for both roots. Then we know that $p_1 + p_2 = 63$ and $p_1 * p_2 = k$. Since $p_1$ and $p_2$ must be prime numbers, this implies that the only way this could work is if the two primes are equal to each other. Then we would know that $k = 63^2$, but since the problem asks for how many possible values of $k$ there are and not what those values are, we need to know the number of ways that 63 can be split into two equal prime numbers. It is also known that 7 is a prime number and it divides 63 which is why $p_1 = p_2 = 7$ (since $63 \\div 7 = 9$, but $p_2 + p_1 \\neq 63$. If you were to divide 63 by another prime, the result would not be an integer. Thus we see that 63 is only divisible by one prime number). Therefore, there is $\\boxed{0}$ possible values of $k$.\n \nNote: This problem assumes that when two numbers are equal and the sum of those numbers is also even (or odd) that those two numbers must both be the same.",
