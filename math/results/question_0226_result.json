  "response": "To find where the line containing the points (1,7) and (3,11) intersects the y-axis, we need to first find the equation of the line.\n\nWe can do this by finding the slope (m) of the line using the formula:\n\nm = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)\n\nwhere (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are the coordinates of the two points. Plugging in the values from our problem:\n\nm = (11 - 7) / (3 - 1)\n= 4/2\n= 2\n\nNow that we have the slope, we can use one of the points to find the y-intercept (b). We will use the point (1,7):\n\n7 = m(1) + b\n7 = 2(1) + b\n7 = 2 + b\n5 = b\n\nSo the equation of the line is:\n\ny = 2x + 5\n\nTo find where this line intersects the y-axis, we set x=0 and solve for y:\n\ny = 2(0) + 5\n= 5",
