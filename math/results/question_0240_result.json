  "response": "To calculate the sum of the given geometric series, we can use the formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series:\n\n$$S = \\frac{a}{1 - r}$$\n\nwhere $a$ is the first term and $r$ is the common ratio.\n\nIn this case, $a = 1$ (the first term) and $r = \\frac{1}{3}$ (the common ratio).\n\nPlugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\n$$S = \\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{1}{3}}$$\n\nSimplifying the denominator, we have:\n\n$$S = \\frac{1}{\\frac{2}{3}}$$\n\nTo divide by a fraction, we multiply by its reciprocal. So, multiplying both the numerator and denominator by $\\frac{3}{2}$, we get:\n\n$$S = \\frac{1}{\\frac{2}{3}} \\cdot \\frac{3}{2} = \\frac{3}{2}$$\n\nTherefore, the sum of the given geometric series is $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{2}}$.",
