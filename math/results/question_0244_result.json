  "response": "To find the x-value where there is a vertical asymptote, we need to look for values of x that make the denominator equal to zero.\n\nThe denominator is 5x - 7. Setting this equal to zero and solving for x gives us:\n\n5x - 7 = 0\n5x = 7\nx = 7/5\n\nTherefore, there is a vertical asymptote at x = 7/5.",
