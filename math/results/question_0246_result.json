  "question_text": "What value of $k$ will make $x^2 - 16x + k$ the square of a binomial?",
  "response": "To find the value of $k$, we need to complete the square.\n\nThe general form for the square of a binomial is:\n\n$(a-b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2$\n\nWe can compare this with the given quadratic expression:\n\n$x^2 - 16x + k$\n\nWe know that the coefficient of $x$ in the original expression must be equal to twice the product of the two terms inside the binomial, i.e. $-16 = -2 \\cdot a \\cdot b$. Therefore, we can write:\n\n$a + b = 8$\n\nThe square of the binomial is $(x-a)^2$, which equals $a^2 - 2ax + a^2$.\n\nWe need to rewrite this expression as $a^2 - 16x + k$:\n\n$x^2 - 2ax + a^2 - 16x + k$\n\nSince we have the same first and third terms, we can write $k = a^2$. Now we know that our square is $(x-a)^2 = x^2 - 2ax + a^2$, so to make it equal to $x^2-16x+k$ we need:\n\na^2 = k\nand \n16=2*a\nthus a =8\n\nSo, the value of $k$ will be $a^2$, where $a$ is $8$. \n\nHence, k = 64",
