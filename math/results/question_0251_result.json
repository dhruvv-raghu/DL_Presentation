  "response": "Let's use Vieta's formulas for quadratic equations to find the roots and their squares.\n\nIf we let $r_1$ and $r_2$ be the two real roots, we know that:\n\n$r_1 + r_2 = -\\frac{12}{8} = -\\frac{3}{2}$\n\n$r_1 \\cdot r_2 = \\frac{-14}{8} = -\\frac{7}{4}$\n\nThe sum of the squares of the roots is $r_1^2+r_2^2=(r_1+r_2)^2-2r_1r_2$.\n\nSubstituting our values for $(r_1+r_2)$ and $(r_1 \\cdot r_2)$ gives us:\n\n$r_1^2+r_2^2 = \\left(-\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^2 - 2\\cdot \\left(\\frac{-7}{4}\\right) = \\frac{9}{4} + \\frac{14}{4}$\n\nTherefore, the sum of the squares of these roots is $\\frac{23}{4}$.",
