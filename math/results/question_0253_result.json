  "response": "## Step 1: To simplify the given expression, we need to combine like terms.\nThe given expression is $$(x^3+4x^2-7x+11)+(-4x^4-x^3+x^2+7x+3).$$ We will start by removing the parentheses and combining like terms.\n\n## Step 2: Remove the parentheses and rearrange the terms in decreasing order of degree.\nThe expression becomes $$-4x^4+(x^3-x^3)+4x^2+(7x-7x)+(11+3).$$\n\n## Step 3: Combine the like terms.\nThis simplifies to $$-4x^4+0x^3+4x^2+0x+14.$$\n\n## Step 4: Write the simplified expression as a polynomial with the terms in order by decreasing degree.\nThe simplified expression is $$-4x^4+4x^2+14.$$\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{-4x^4+4x^2+14}$",
