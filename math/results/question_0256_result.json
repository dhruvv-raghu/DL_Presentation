  "question_text": "The graphs of $2y + x + 3 = 0$  and $3y + ax + 2 = 0$ are perpendicular. Solve for $a.$",
  "response": "We have that the slopes of the lines are $-\\tfrac{1}{2}$ and $-\\tfrac{a}{3}$. Since these lines are perpendicular, we must have that their slopes are negative reciprocals:\n\n$$\\left(-\\tfrac{1}{2}\\right)\\cdot\\left(-\\tfrac{a}{3}\\right)=1,$$so $\\boxed{a=6}$.\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{6}$.",
