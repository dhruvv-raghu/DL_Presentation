  "question_text": "The positive difference between the two roots of the quadratic equation $3x^2 - 7x - 8 = 0$ can be written as $\\frac{\\sqrt{m}}{n}$, where $n$ is an integer and $m$ is an integer not divisible by the square of any prime number. Find $m + n$.",
  "response": "## Step 1: Recall the quadratic formula to find roots\nThe quadratic formula states that for a quadratic equation in the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0, the solutions are given by x = (-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / (2a).\n\n## Step 2: Apply the quadratic formula to the given equation\nUsing the quadratic formula with a = 3, b = -7, and c = -8, we have x = (7 ± sqrt((-7)^2 - 4(3)(-8))) / (2(3)).\n\n## Step 3: Simplify the expression inside the square root\nThe expression inside the square root simplifies to (-7)^2 - 4(3)(-8) = 49 + 96 = 145.\n\n## Step 4: Write the full formula for the roots\nThus, the two solutions are x = (7 ± sqrt(145)) / 6.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the difference between the roots\nThe positive difference between the two roots is given by ((7 + sqrt(145)) / 6) - ((7 - sqrt(145)) / 6).\n\n## Step 6: Simplify the expression for the difference of the roots\nSimplifying, we get (2*sqrt(145)) / 6 = sqrt(145) / 3.\n\n## Step 7: Identify m and n in the given format\nComparing this to the desired format, we have m = 145 and n = 3.\n\n## Step 8: Calculate m + n as requested by the problem\nTherefore, m + n is 145 + 3 = 148.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{148}$",
