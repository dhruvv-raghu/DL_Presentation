  "response": "To solve this system of equations, we can use the method of elimination or substitution. Here, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, let's multiply the two equations by necessary multiples such that the coefficients of $y$'s in both equations are the same:\n\nMultiplying the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 5, we get:\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-10y&=-3\\\\\n35x+10y&=23.5.\n\\end{align*}\n\nNow, let's add both equations to eliminate $y$:\n\n$(6x-10y)+(35x+10y)=(-3)+23.5$\n\\begin{align*}\n41x&=20.5\\\\\nx&=\\frac{20.5}{41}\\\\\n&=0.5\n\\end{align*}\n\nNow that we have the value of $x$, substitute this into one of the original equations to solve for $y$. We'll use the first equation:\n\n$3(0.5)-5y=-1.5$\n\\begin{align*}\n1.5-5y&=-1.5\\\\\n-5y&=-1.5-1.5\\\\\n-5y&=-3.0\\\\\ny&=\\frac{-3.0}{-5}\\\\\n&=0.6\n\\end{align*}\n\nTherefore, the solution to the system of equations is $\\boxed{(x,y)=(0.5,0.6)}.$",
