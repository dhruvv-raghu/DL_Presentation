  "response": "The quadratic can be simplified to $x^2 + 30x +216 = 0.$ The quadratic formula gives $\\frac{-30 \\pm \\sqrt{900 - 864}}{2} = \\frac{-30 \\pm 6}{2},$ so the two roots are $\\frac{-30 + 6}{2} = -12$ and $\\frac{-30 - 6}{2} = -18.$ The difference between them is $|-12| - |-18|= 30,$ which is the answer.",
