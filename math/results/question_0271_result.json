  "question_text": "Find the center of the circle with equation $x^2 - 2x + y^2 - 4y - 28 = 0$.",
  "response": "To find the center of the circle, we need to rewrite the equation in standard form. First, complete the square for both x and y terms:\n\n$x^2 - 2x + y^2 - 4y - 28 = 0$\n\n$(x^2 - 2x) + (y^2 - 4y) = 28$\n\n$(x^2 - 2x + 1) + (y^2 - 4y + 4) = 28 + 1 + 4$\n\n$(x-1)^2 + (y-2)^2 = 33$\n\nNow, we can see that the center of the circle is at the point $(1, 2)$.\n\nTherefore, the center of the circle with equation $x^2 - 2x + y^2 - 4y - 28 = 0$ is $(1, 2)$.",
