  "question_text": "Circle $O$ is located on the coordinate plane with center at $(2,3)$.  One endpoint of a diameter is at $(-1,-1)$.  What are the coordinates of the other endpoint of this diameter?  Express your answer as an ordered pair.",
  "response": "The distance between two points in a coordinate plane can be calculated using the distance formula.\n\nTo find the coordinates of the second endpoint of the diameter, we need to travel the same distance from (-1,-1) as from (2,3), but in the opposite direction.  We will use this fact along with the midpoint formula to calculate the other endpoint of a diameter given one endpoint and the center of the circle.\n\nThe midpoint formula is:\n\n$$\\left(\\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \\frac{y_1 + y_2}{2} \\right) = \\left(x_m, y_m\\right)$$\n\nWe can use this formula to find the coordinates of one endpoint of a diameter given the center and midpoint of that diameter.\n\nLet $$(x, y)$$ be an endpoint of a diameter.  Then the midpoint is:\n\n$$(2 + x)/2, (3 + y)/2)$$\n\nSince we know (-1,-1) is also on this diameter, let's find its coordinates in terms of $$x$$ and $$y$$.\n\n$$-1 = (2+x)/2 \\Rightarrow 2+x=-4\\Rightarrow x=-6\\\\ -1 = (3+y)/2 \\Rightarrow 3+y=-2\\Rightarrow y=-5$$\n\nNow that we know (-1,-1) is an endpoint of this diameter, we can use the midpoint formula to find the other endpoint.\n\n$$(x_m,y_m)=((-6+2)/2,(-5+3)/2)=(-2,-1)$$\n\nSo $$(x_m, y_m)=(2 + x, 3 + y)=(-2,-1)$$. We can solve for x and y to find the coordinates of this endpoint.\n\n$$2+x=-2\\Rightarrow x=-4\\\\ 3+y=-1\\Rightarrow y=-4$$\n\nSo the other endpoint of the diameter is (-4,-4).\n\nAlternatively, we can use the distance formula to verify that the two endpoints are a diameter.\n\nThe distance from $$(x_1,y_1) = (2,3)$$ and $$(x_2,y_2)=(2+6, 3-4)=(-4,-1)$$ is\n\n$$(x_2-x_1)^2+(y_2-y_1)^2=(-4-2)^2 + (-1-3)^2 = 36 + 16=52$$\nThe distance from $$(x_1,y_1)=(2,3)$$ and $$(x_2,y_2)=(-6,-5)$$ is\n\n$$(x_2-x_1)^2+(y_2-y_1)^2=(-6-2)^2+ (-5-3)^2=64 + 64 = 128$$\n\nSince the two endpoints are a diameter, we must have $$(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2 = (diameter)^2$$.",
