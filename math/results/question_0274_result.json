  "response": "To solve this problem, we need to simplify the right-hand side of the equation by expressing all the terms in powers of 3.\n\nWe have:\n\n$$3^1 = 3$$\n$$3^2 = 9$$\n$$3^4 = 81$$\n\nSo, we can rewrite the right-hand side as follows:\n\n$$3 \\cdot 9^3 \\cdot 81^2 = 3 \\cdot (3^2)^3 \\cdot (3^4)^2$$\n\nUsing exponent rules, we have:\n\n$$(3^2)^3 = 3^{2\\cdot3} = 3^6$$\n$$(3^4)^2 = 3^{4\\cdot2} = 3^8$$\n\nTherefore, the right-hand side becomes:\n\n$$3 \\cdot 3^6 \\cdot 3^8 = 3^{1+6+8} = 3^{15}$$\n\nNow we can equate this to the left-hand side:\n\n$$3^n = 3^{15}$$\n\nSince the bases are equal, we know that the exponents must be equal as well. Therefore, we have:\n\n$$n = 15$$\n\nSo, the value of $n$ is $\\boxed{15}$.",
