  "question_text": "The graph of the quadratic $y = ax^2 + bx + c$ has the following properties: (1) The maximum value of $y = ax^2 + bx + c$ is 5, which occurs at $x = 3$. (2) The graph passes through the point $(0,-13)$. If the graph passes through the point $(4,m)$, then what is the value of $m$?",
  "response": "To solve this problem, we will use the given properties to find the equation of the quadratic and then evaluate it at x = 4.\n\nFirst, let's note that since the maximum value occurs at a vertex that lies on the graph, it must occur at the point (3,5). This tells us the following:\n\n(1) Vertex: (3,5)\n(2) y-intercept: (-13,0)\n\nSince the parabola has a maximum value of 5 and passes through the vertex (3,5), we can write its equation in the form:\n \ny = a(x-3)^2 + 5\n \nSince it also passes through the point (0,-13), we have\n\n-13 = a(0-3)^2 + 5\n-18 = 9a\na = -2\n\nNow that we know the value of 'a', we can plug in x=4 to evaluate m:\n\nm = (-2)(4-3)^2 + 5\n= (-2)(1)^2 + 5\n= (-2) + 5\n= 3 \n\nTherefore, the value of m is 3.",
