  "response": "To find f(3), we need to use the given function f(x) = ax + bx + 2.\n\nFirst, let's rewrite the equation as:\n\nf(x) = (a+b)x + 2\n\nWe know that f(1)=5 and f(2)=8. \n\nUsing this information, we can write two equations:\n\n5 = (a+b)(1) + 2\n8 = (a+b)(2) + 2\n\nSubtracting 2 from both sides of each equation gives us:\n\n3 = a + b \n6 = 2(a+b)\n\nSince the second equation is true for all values of x, we can equate it to the first equation:\n\n3 = a+b\n6 = 2a+2b \n\nMultiplying the first equation by 2 gives us:\n6 = 2a+2b\n\nWe know that both equations are equal. So, let's set them equal to each other.\n\n6=3\n This is not true for any value of 'a' and 'b'.\n\nNow, we will substitute these values in f(x) = (a+b)x + 2\n\nf(1)=5 \nSubstituting x=1 gives us:\n\n5 = (a+b)(1)+2 \n\nNow solving the equation above using our knowledge that a+b is 3 from 3= a+b we get \n\n5=(3)(1)+2 \n5= 3+2\n5=5\n\nf(2)=8 \nSubstituting x=2 gives us:\n\n8 = (a+b)(2) + 2\n\nNow solving the equation above using our knowledge that a+b is 3 from 3=a+b we get \n\n8=(3)(2)+2\n8=6+2\n8=8\n\nSo f(x)= (a+b)x + 2 where a+b = 3 satisfies both conditions.\n\nf(3) = (a+b)(3) + 2 \nSubstituting the value of 'a' and 'b' we get \n\nf(3)=(3)(3)+2\nf(3)=9+2 \nf(3)=11\n\nTherefore, f(3) is equal to 11.",
