  "question_text": "What is the minimum possible value for $y$ in the equation $y = x^2 + 12x + 5$?",
  "response": "To find the minimum possible value of y, we need to find the vertex of the parabola.\n\nThe x-coordinate of the vertex can be found using the formula:\n\nx = -b/2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1 and b = 12. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nx = -12/(2*1)\n= -12/2\n= -6\n\nNow that we have the x-coordinate of the vertex, we can plug it back into the equation to find the y-coordinate:\n\ny = (-6)^2 + 12(-6) + 5\n= 36 - 72 + 5\n= -31\n\nTherefore, the minimum possible value for y is -31.",
