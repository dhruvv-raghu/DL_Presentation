  "response": "The smallest possible real value of $x^2+8x$ occurs when we have the vertex of the parabola represented by $y = x^2+8x$. We can find this vertex using the formula $-\\frac{b}{2a}$ for the function in standard form, which is $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$, where $a$ and $b$ are constants.\n\nIn our equation, we have $x^2 + 8x$. Comparing with standard form, we see that $a=1$ and $b=8$. \n\nSubstituting these values into the formula $-\\frac{b}{2a}$ gives us:\n\n\\[-\\frac{8}{2(1)} = -4.\\]\n\nTo find the value of $x^2+8x$ when it is at its smallest, we need to plug in this x-value back into our original function and solve for y. This means we substitute $-4$ into $x$, so that we get $(-4)^2 + 8(-4) = 16 -32$. We can simplify this as follows:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n  (-4)^2 + 8(-4)&=16 -32\\\\\n  &=-16.\n\\end{align*}\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible real value of $x^2+8x$ is $\\boxed{-16}.$",
