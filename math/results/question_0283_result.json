  "response": "To calculate the sum, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:\n\nn/2 × (a1 + an)\n\nwhere n is the number of terms, a1 is the first term, and an is the last term.\n\nIn this case, we have:\n\n* First term (a1) = 1\n* Last term (an) = 17\n* The common difference between consecutive terms is 2\n\nWe can find the number of terms by using the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic series:\n\nan = a1 + (n - 1)d\n\nwhere d is the common difference.\n\nSubstituting in our values, we get:\n\n17 = 1 + (n - 1)2\n16 = (n - 1)2\n8 = n - 1\n9 = n\n\nSo there are 9 terms in the series.\n\nNow we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to find the answer:\n\nS = n/2 × (a",
