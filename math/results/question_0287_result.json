  "response": "To solve for $n$, we can rewrite both sides of the equation with a common base, which in this case will be $2$. \n\nWe have that $4 = 2^2$ and $8 = 2^3$. Therefore,\n\n$$4^6=(2^2)^6=2^{12}.$$\n\nSimilarly,\n\n$$8^n=(2^3)^n=2^{3n}.$$Therefore, we can equate the exponents:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n12&=3n\\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\qquad n&=\\frac{12}{3}=4.\n\\end{align*}\n\nThus, $n = 4.$",
