  "question_text": "The fifth and eighth terms of a geometric sequence of real numbers are $7!$ and $8!$ respectively. What is the first term?",
  "response": "To find the first term, we need to know the common ratio.\n\nThe formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence is:\nan = ar^(n-1)\nwhere 'a' is the first term, 'r' is the common ratio, and 'n' is the term number.\n\nGiven that the fifth term (ar^(5-1) or a*r^4) is 7!, and the eighth term (ar^(8-1) or a*r^7) is 8!.\n\nWe can set up an equation using the first expression:\na*r^4 = 5040\nand using the second expression:\na*r^7 = 40320\n\nNow, we need to find r by dividing these two equations. Divide both sides of each equation:\nr^3 = (8!)/(7!) \n= 8*7\n= 56\n\nNow we can solve for 'a' by substituting the value of r into either equation.\n\nLet's use a*r^4 = 5040 and substitute r = ∛56. \nWe have, ar^(4) = 5040 \na*(∛56)^4 = 5040 \n\nSince (∛56)^4 = (∛56*∛56*∛56)^2 = (∛(56^3))^2\n= ((∛56)^3)^2\nWe can substitute this into our equation to get:\na*(∛(56^3))^2 = 5040 \na*(56^(1/3))^6 = 5040 \n\nSince (56^(1/3))^6 is equal to ∛56^2, and we know r=∛56\nwe can substitute r into our original equation:\nar^4 = 5040 \nar^2 = a*∛(56^2) \nWe have ar^2 = a*r^(2) and now it is easy to find 'a' as follows:\nar^2 = a*r^(2) \na = 5040/(∛56^2) \n\nWe can calculate the numerical value of 'a' using this expression.\na = 5040/((∛(56^2))^1)\n= 5040/(∛(3136))\nSince (∛(3136)) is 56\na = 5040/56 \n= 90",
