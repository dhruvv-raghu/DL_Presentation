  "question_text": "Given that $f(x) = x^k$ where $k > 0$, what is the range of $f(x)$ on the interval $[1, \\infty)$?",
  "response": "To find the range of $f(x)$, we need to consider the behavior of the function as $x$ approaches infinity.\n\nSince $k>0$, the function $f(x) = x^k$ is increasing on the interval $[1, \\infty)$.\n\nAs $x$ approaches infinity, $x^k$ also approaches infinity. Therefore, there is no upper bound for the values that $f(x)$ can take on the interval $[1, \\infty)$.\n\nHowever, when $x = 1$, $f(x) = 1^k = 1$. So, $f(1) = 1$.\n\nSince $f(x)$ is increasing and has a minimum value of 1, the range of $f(x)$ on the interval $[1, \\infty)$ is $[1, \\infty)$.\n\nTherefore, the range of $f(x)$ on the interval $[1, \\infty)$ is $\\boxed{[1,\\infty)}$.",
