  "response": "To find the sum of the integers between 3 and 12, we need to first identify all the integers in this range. The integers between 3 and 12 are:\n\n4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11\n\nThe sum of these integers is:\n\n4 + 5 = 9\n9 + 6 = 15\n15 + 7 = 22\n22 + 8 = 30\n30 + 9 = 39\n39 + 10 = 49\n49 + 11 = 60\n\nSo, the sum of the integers between 3 and 12 is 60.",
