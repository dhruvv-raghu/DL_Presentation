  "response": "To find the sum of all integers between -12.1 and 3.3, we need to first find the range of integers that fall within this interval.\n\nThe smallest integer greater than -12.1 is -12.\nThe largest integer less than 3.3 is 3.\n\nSo, the range of integers is from -12 to 3.\n\nTo find the sum of an arithmetic series, we can use the formula:\n\nSum = (n/2) \\* (first term + last term)\n\nwhere n is the number of terms in the series.\n\nIn this case, there are 16 terms (-12, -11, ..., 0, ..., 3).\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nSum = (16/2) \\* (-12 + 3)\n= 8 \\* (-9)\n= -72\n\nTherefore, the sum of all integers between -12.1 and 3.3 is -72",
