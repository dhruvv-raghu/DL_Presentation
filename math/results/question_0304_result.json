  "question_text": "A quadratic equation $ax^2 - 2ax + b = 0$ has two real solutions. What is the average of these two solutions?",
  "response": "To find the average of the two real solutions, we first need to find the sum and product of the roots.\n\nThe sum of the roots can be found using the formula $\\frac{-b}{a}$, where $b$ is the coefficient of the linear term. In this case, the coefficient of the linear term is $-2a$, so the sum of the roots is:\n\n$\\frac{2a}{a} = 2$\n\nThe product of the roots can be found using the formula $\\frac{c}{a}$, where $c$ is the constant term. However, since this is a quadratic equation with real solutions, we know that $b^2 - 4ac \\geq 0$. In our case, the constant term is $b$, so:\n\n$b^2 - 4ac = (-2a)^2 - 4(a)(b) = 4a^2 - 4ab$\n\nFor this to be greater than or equal to zero for all values of a and b, it must hold that  $a \\geq 0$. \n\nSince we know the equation has real roots, we can use Vieta's formulas. We get the sum of the solutions as $\\frac{-(-2a)}{a} = \\frac{2a}{a}$\n\nWe also have $(x_1 + x_2)^2 = (x_1)^2 + 2x_1x_2 + (x_2)^2$, so we get:\n\n$(x_1 + x_2)^2 = x_1^2 + 2x_1x_2 + x_2^2$\n\nWe know $x_1 + x_2 = \\frac{2a}{a}$. Plugging this into our equation above, and multiplying both sides by $\\frac{4}{4}$ to simplify:\n\n$(\\frac{2a}{a})^2 = x_1^2 + 2x_1x_2 + x_2^2$\n\nWe know $x_1 + x_2 = \\frac{2a}{a}$. Plugging this into our equation above, and multiplying both sides by $\\frac{4}{4}$ to simplify:\n\n$\\frac{4a^2}{a^2} = 4x_1x_2$\n\nThis simplifies to $4 = \\frac{8a^2}{a^2}$.\n\nWe can multiply both sides by $\\frac{-4a^2}{-4a^2}$\n\n$4 = 2$\n\nTherefore, the average of these two solutions is equal to $\\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}$.",
