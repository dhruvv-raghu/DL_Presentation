  "response": "To find the smallest value of x, we need to solve for when the absolute value equals a positive number.\n\nWe have two possible equations:\n\n3x + 7 = 26\n\nor \n\n3x + 7 = -26\n\nSolving for the first equation: \n3x + 7 = 26\n3x = 19\nx = 6.33 \n\nSolving for the second equation:\n3x + 7 = -26\n3x = -33\nx = -11 \n\nSince we want the smallest value of x, the answer is x = -11",
