  "question_text": "What is the area enclosed by the region defined by the equation $x^2+y^2+12x+16y=0$?",
  "response": "To find the area of the region, we need to rewrite the equation in standard form.\n\nWe can start by completing the square for both x and y terms:\n\n$x^2 + 12x = (x+6)^2 - 36$\n$y^2 + 16y = (y+8)^2 - 64$\n\nNow, substitute these back into the original equation:\n\n$(x+6)^2 - 36 + (y+8)^2 - 64 = 0$\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n$(x+6)^2 + (y+8)^2 = 100$\n\nThis is the standard form of a circle with center (-6, -8) and radius 10.\n\nThe area of a circle can be calculated using the formula A = πr^2. Plugging in the radius r=10, we get:\n\nA = π(10)^2\nA = 100π\n\nSo, the area enclosed by the region defined by the equation is approximately 314 square units (using π ≈ 3.14).",
