  "question_text": "A rectangular room measures 12-feet by 6-feet. How many square yards of carpet are needed to cover the floor of the room?",
  "response": "To find the area of the room in square feet, we need to multiply the length and width.\n\nLength (l) = 12 feet\nWidth (w) = 6 feet\n\nArea (A) = l x w = 12 x 6 = 72 square feet\n\nSince there are 9 square feet in a square yard, we can convert the area by dividing by 9:\n\n72 square feet / 9 square feet per square yard = 8 square yards\n\nTherefore, 8 square yards of carpet are needed to cover the floor of the room.",
