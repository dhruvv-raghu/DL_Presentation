  "response": "To solve this problem, we need to simplify the expression on the left-hand side.\n\n$$16^3\\times8^3 = (2^4)^3 \\times (2^3)^3$$\n\nUsing the property of exponents $(a^m)^n=a^{mn}$, we get\n\n$$(2^4)^3 \\times (2^3)^3=2^{12} \\times 2^{9}=2^{21}.$$\n\nSo the equation becomes $2^{21}=2^K$, and since the bases are equal, we can equate the exponents to solve for K:\n\n$$K = 21.$$",
