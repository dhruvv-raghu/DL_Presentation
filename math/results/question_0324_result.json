  "question_text": "The center of the circle with equation $x^2+y^2=8x-6y-20$ is the point $(x,y)$. What is $x+y$?",
  "response": "To find the center of the circle, we need to put the equation into standard form. First, let's group the x terms and y terms together.\n\n\\begin{align*}\nx^2+8x +y^2-6y&=20\\\\\nx^2+8x+y^2-6y-20&=0\\\\\n(x^2+8x) +(y^2-6y)&=20\n\\end{align*}Next, complete the squares.\n\n\\begin{align*}\n(x^2+8x +16) +(y^2-6y+9)&=20+16+9\\\\\n(x^2+8x+16)+ (y^2-6y+9)&=45\\\\\n(x+4)^2+(y-3)^2&=45\n\\end{align*}Now the equation is in standard form. We can see that the center of the circle is $(x,y)=(-4,3)$. Therefore $x+y=-1$",
