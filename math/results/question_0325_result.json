  "question_text": "If $x$ is a real number and $x^2-7x+6<0$, what are the possible values for $x$? Use interval notation to express your answer.",
  "response": "To solve this inequality, we first need to factorize the quadratic expression:\n\n$$x^2 - 7x + 6 = (x-1)(x-6)$$\n\nNow, let's use a number line to find the values of $x$ for which $(x-1)(x-6)<0$. \n\nWe can start by finding the zeros of the quadratic expression. Setting each factor equal to zero, we get:\n\n$$x-1=0 \\Rightarrow x = 1$$\n\n$$x-6=0 \\Rightarrow x = 6$$\n\nNow that we have found the zeros, let's plot these points on a number line and test the intervals between them.\n\nInterval 1: $(-\\infty,1)$\nLet's pick a point in this interval, say $x=-5$. Plugging it into our inequality, we get:\n\n$$(x-1)(x-6)=(-5-1)(-5-6)$$\n\nThis is equal to $( - 6 ) ( - 11 ) = 66$, which is greater than zero. Therefore, this interval does not satisfy the inequality.\n\nInterval 2: $(1,6)$\nLet's pick a point in this interval, say $x=3$. Plugging it into our inequality, we get:\n\n$$(x-1)(x-6)=(3-1)(3-6)$$\n\nThis is equal to $( 2 ) ( - 3 ) = -6$, which is less than zero. Therefore, this interval does satisfy the inequality.\n\nInterval 3: $(6,\\infty)$\nLet's pick a point in this interval, say $x=7$. Plugging it into our inequality, we get:\n\n$$(x-1)(x-6)=(7-1)(7-6)$$\n\nThis is equal to $( 6 ) ( 1 ) = 6$, which is greater than zero. Therefore, this interval does not satisfy the inequality.\n\nTherefore, we have found that $x \\in \\boxed{(1,6)}$ is a solution set for $x^2 - 7 x + 6 < 0$.",
