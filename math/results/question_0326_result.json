  "response": "To solve for x, we need to simplify the expression:\n\n$$x = \\dfrac{35}{6-\\frac{2}{5}}$$\n\nWe can start by simplifying the denominator:\n\n$$6 - \\frac{2}{5} = 6 - \\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{30-2}{5} = \\frac{28}{5}$$\n\nNow, we can substitute this value back into the original equation:\n\n$$x = \\dfrac{35}{\\frac{28}{5}}$$\n\nTo divide by a fraction, we multiply by its reciprocal. So, we have:\n\n$$x = 35 \\times \\frac{5}{28}$$\n\nSimplifying further, we get:\n\n$$x = \\frac{175}{28}$$\n\nWe can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 7:\n\n$$x = \\frac{175}{28} = \\frac{25}{4}$$\n\nTherefore, the value of x is $\\boxed{\\dfrac{25}{4}}$.",
