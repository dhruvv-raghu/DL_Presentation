Suppose the codeword that we use to describe a random variable X always starts with a symbol chosen from the set {7, 8, 9} , followed by binary digits {0, 1}. Thus we have a ternary code for the first symbol and binary thereafter. Give the optimal uniquely decodeable code (minimum expected number of symbols) for the probability distribution $p = (16/69, 15/69, 12/69, 10/69, 8/69, 8/69)$.
