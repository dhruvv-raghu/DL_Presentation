Consider Convolutional Neural Network D2 which takes input images of size 32x32 with 1 colour channels. The first layer of D2 uses 4 filters of size 5x5, a stride of 2, and zero-padding of width 1. Consider CNN D2 which takes input images of size 32x32 with 1 colour channels. The first layer of D2 uses 4 filters of size 5x5, a stride of 2, and zero-padding of width 1. What is the total number of weights defined for the entire activation output of this first layer? (ie. If you flattened all filters and channels into a single vector)
