Ellina has twelve blocks, two each of red ( $\textbf{R}$ ), blue ( $\textbf{B}$ ), yellow ( $\textbf{Y}$ ), green ( $\textbf{G}$ ), orange ( $\textbf{O}$ ), and purple ( $\textbf{P}$ ). Call an arrangement of blocks $\textit{even}$ if there is an even number of blocks between each pair of blocks of the same color. For example, the arrangement \[\textbf{R B B Y G G Y R O P P O}\] is even. Ellina arranges her blocks in a row in random order. The probability that her arrangement is even is $\frac{m}{n},$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n.$
