On a board the following six vectors are written: \((1,0,0), \quad(-1,0,0), \quad(0,1,0), \quad(0,-1,0), \quad(0,0,1), \quad(0,0,-1)\). Given two vectors \(v\) and \(w\) on the board, a move consists of erasing \(v\) and \(w\) and replacing them with \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(v+w)\) and \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(v-w)\). After some number of moves, the sum of the six vectors on the board is \(u\). Find, with proof, the maximum possible length of \(u\).
