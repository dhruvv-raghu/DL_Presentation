A point charge $+q$ is placed a distance $a$ away from an infinitely large conducting plate. The force of the electrostatic interaction is $F_{0}$. Then, an identical conducting plate is placed a distance $3 a$ from the charge, parallel to the first one such that the charge is "sandwiched in." The new electrostatic force the particle feels is $F^{\prime}$. What is $F^{\prime} / F_{0}$ ? Round to the nearest hundredths.
