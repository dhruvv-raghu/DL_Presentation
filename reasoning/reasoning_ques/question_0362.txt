Consider an LC circuit with one inductor and one capacitor. The amplitude of the charge on the plates of the capacitor is $Q=10 \mathrm{C}$ and the two plates are initially at a distance $d=1 \mathrm{~cm}$ away from each other. The plates are then slowly pushed together to a distance $0.5 \mathrm{~cm}$ from each other. Find the resultant amplitude of charge on the parallel plates of the capacitor after this process is completed. Note that the initial current in the circuit is zero and assume that the plates are grounded.
