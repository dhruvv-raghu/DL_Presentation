Do either  $(1)$  or  $(2)$  $(1)$     $x$  and  $y$  are functions of  $t.$  Solve  $x' = x + y - 3, y' = -2x + 3y + 1,$  given that  $x(0) = y(0) = 0.$  $(2)$    A weightless rod is hinged at  $O$  so that it can rotate without friction in a vertical plane. A mass  $m$  is attached to the end of the rod  $A,$  which is balanced vertically above  $O.$  At time  $t = 0,$  the rod moves away from the vertical with negligible initial angular velocity. Prove that the mass first reaches the position under  $O$  at  $t = \sqrt{(\frac{OA}{g})} \ln{(1 + sqrt(2))}.$
