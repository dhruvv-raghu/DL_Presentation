Von Neumann's Poker: The first step in Von Neumann's game is selecting a random number on $[0,1]$. To generate this number, Chebby uses the factorial base: the number $0 . A_{1} A_{2} A_{3} A_{4} \ldots$ stands for $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{A_{n}}{(n+1)!}$, where each $A_{n}$ is an integer between 0 and $n$, inclusive. Chebby has an infinite number of cards labeled $0, 1, 2, \ldots$. He begins by putting cards $0$ and $1$ into a hat and drawing randomly to determine $A_{1}$. The card assigned $A_{1}$ does not get reused. Chebby then adds in card 2 and draws for $A_{2}$, and continues in this manner to determine the random number. At each step, he only draws one card from two in the hat. Unfortunately, this method does not result in a uniform distribution. What is the expected value of Chebby's final number?
