Consider in particular the ion $\mathrm{A}^{(\mathrm{Z}-2)+}$ is at rest in the ground state when capturing an additional electron and the captured electron is also at rest prior to the capturing. Determine the numerical value of $Z$, if the frequency of the emitted photon accompanying electron capturing is $2,057\times 10^{17} \mathrm{rad} / \mathrm{s}$. Identify the element which gives rise to the ion.
