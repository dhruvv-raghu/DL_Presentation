A small point-like object is thrown horizontally off of a  $50.0$ - $\text{m}$  high building with an initial speed of  $10.0 \text{ m/s}$ .  At any point along the trajectory there is an acceleration component tangential to the trajectory and an acceleration component perpendicular to the trajectory.  How many seconds after the object is thrown  is the tangential component of the acceleration of the object equal to twice the perpendicular component of the acceleration of the object?  Ignore air resistance. $ \textbf{(A)}\ 2.00\text{ s}$  $\textbf{(B)}\ 1.50\text{ s}$  $\textbf{(C)}\ 1.00\text{ s}$  $\textbf{(D)}\ 0.50\text{ s}$  $\textbf{(E)}\ \text{The building is not high enough for this to occur.} $
