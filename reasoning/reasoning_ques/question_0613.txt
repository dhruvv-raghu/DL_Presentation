In three-dimensional space, let $S$ be the region of points $(x, y, z)$ satisfying $-1 \leq z \leq 1$. Let $S_{1}, S_{2}, \ldots, S_{2022}$ be 2022 independent random rotations of $S$ about the origin ( $0,0,0$). The expected volume of the region $S_{1} \cap S_{2} \cap \cdots \cap S_{2022}$ can be expressed as $\frac{a \pi}{b}$, for relatively prime positive integers $a$ and $b$. Compute $100 a+b$.
