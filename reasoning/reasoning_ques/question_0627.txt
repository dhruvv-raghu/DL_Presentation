For some complex number  $\omega$  with  $|\omega| = 2016$ , there is some real  $\lambda>1$  such that  $\omega, \omega^{2},$  and  $\lambda \omega$  form an equilateral triangle in the complex plane. Then,  $\lambda$  can be written in the form  $\tfrac{a + \sqrt{b}}{c}$ , where  $a,b,$  and  $c$  are positive integers and  $b$  is squarefree. Compute  $\sqrt{a+b+c}$ .
