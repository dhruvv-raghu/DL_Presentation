Tom is chasing Jerry on the coordinate plane. Tom starts at  $(x, y)$  and Jerry starts at  $(0, 0)$ . Jerry moves to the right at  $1$  unit per second. At each positive integer time  $t$ , if Tom is within  $1$  unit of Jerry, he hops to Jerry’s location and catches him. Otherwise, Tom hops to the midpoint of his and Jerry’s location.

*Example. If Tom starts at  $(3, 2)$ , then at time  $t = 1$  Tom will be at  $(2, 1)$  and Jerry will be at  $(1, 0)$ . At  $t = 2$  Tom will catch Jerry.*

Assume that Tom catches Jerry at some integer time  $n$ .
(a) Show that  $x \geq 0$ .
(b) Find the maximum possible value of  $\frac{y}{x+1}$ .
