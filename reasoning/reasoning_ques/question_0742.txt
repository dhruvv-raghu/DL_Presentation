Today is Barbara's birthday, and Alberto wants to give her a gift playing the following game. The numbers 0,1,2,...,1024 are written on a blackboard. First Barbara erases  $2^{9}$  numbers, then Alberto erases  $2^{8}$  numbers, then Barbara  $2^{7}$  and so on, until there are only two numbers a,b left. Now Barbara earns  $|a-b|$  euro.
Find the maximum number of euro that Barbara can always win, independently of Alberto's strategy.
