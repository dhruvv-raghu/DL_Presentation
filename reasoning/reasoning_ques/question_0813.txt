Let  $a_1,a_2,\dots,a_{100}$  be a sequence of integers. Initially,  $a_1=1$ ,  $a_2=-1$  and the remaining numbers are  $0$ . After every second, we perform the following process on the sequence: for  $i=1,2,\dots,99$ , replace  $a_i$  with  $a_i+a_{i+1}$ , and replace  $a_{100}$  with  $a_{100}+a_1$ . (All of this is done simultaneously, so each new term is the sum of two terms of the sequence from before any replacements.) Show that for any integer  $M$ , there is some index  $i$  and some time  $t$  for which  $|a_i|>M$  at time  $t$ .
