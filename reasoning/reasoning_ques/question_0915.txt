Each lattice point with nonnegative coordinates is labeled with a nonnegative integer in such away that the point  $(0, 0)$  is labeled by  $0$ , and for every  $x, y \geq 0$ , the set of numbers labeled on thepoints  $(x, y), (x, y + 1),$  and  $(x + 1, y)$  is  $\{n, n + 1, n + 2\}$  for some nonnegative integer  $n$ . Determine,with proof, all possible labels for the point  $(2000, 2024)$ .
