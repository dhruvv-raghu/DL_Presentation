A train pulls out of the station at constant velocity. The received signal energy thus falls off with time as $1/i^2$. The total received signal at time $i$ is $Y_i = \frac{1}{i}X_i + Z_i$ where $Z_1, Z_2, \ldots$ are i.i.d. drawn from $N(0,1)$. The transmitter constraint for block length $n$ is $\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2(w) \leq 2  $ for $w \in \{1,2,\ldots, 2^{nR}\}$. Use Fano's inequality to find the capacity for this channel.
