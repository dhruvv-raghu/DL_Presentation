    "Let  $a,b,A,B$  be given reals. We consider the function defined by \\[ f(x) = 1 - a \\cdot \\cos(x) - b \\cdot \\sin(x) - A \\cdot \\cos(2x) - B \\cdot \\sin(2x). \\] Prove that if for any real number  $x$  we have  $f(x) \\geq 0$  then  $a^2 + b^2 \\leq 2$  and  $A^2 + B^2 \\leq 1.$",
    "The given function can be rewritten as\n\\begin{align*}\nf(x)&=1-a\\cos x-b\\sin x-A\\cos(2x)-B\\sin(2x)\\\\&=\\left(1-\\frac12a^2\\right)\\cos^2x+\\left(\\frac12b^2-\\frac14c^2\\right)\\sin^2x+Ab\\cos x+B\\cos (2x).\n\\end{align*}Using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,\n\\begin{align*}\nf(x)&=\\left(1-\\frac12a^2\\right)(\\cos^2x+\\sin^2x)+\\left(\\frac12b^2-\\frac14c^2\\right)(\\sin^2x+\\cos^2x)\\\\&\\quad+Ab\\cos x+B\\cos(2x)\\\\&=\\left(1-\\frac12a^2\\right)+(B+c)\\cos x.\n\\end{align*}Because $f(x)$ is always non-negative, we obtain\n$$\\left(1-\\frac12a^2\\right)+|B+c|\\leq0.$$Therefore, $\\boxed{\\frac12a^2\\geq 1}$ and $|B+c|=-(1-\\frac12a^2)\\leq 0$ for any real numbers $x$. This means that $c=0$, and since $b=\\sin(-\\theta)=\\cos(\\theta)$, we have $\\boxed{A^2+B^2=1}$.\n\nNow that you know how to find the value of A and B, using your values of a and b, find the maximum possible value for a and b. Since we are looking for the maxima, we want all the terms in the equation to be negative. Therefore, $a\\geq 2$ and $b\\leq-1$. However, because of the given conditions, if both are too high then $A^2+B^2>1$, so there is a bound on these values as well.\n\nThis means that our final answer for $(a,b)$ must be such that\n\n$$a=\\min(2,\\sqrt{2},-\\sqrt{2})=2,$$\n\nand\n\n$$b=\\max(-1,1)=1.$$The maximum possible value of $a$ and the minimum possible value of $b$ are therefore $\\boxed{(2,-1)}$, which means that $(a,b)$ must lie in the interval $[-1,2]$. Therefore, if we know both A and B then $a$ and $b$ must be in $[-1,2]$.\n\nTo summarize, given any values of $A$ and $B$, $a^2 + b^2 \\leq 2$ and $a,b\\in [-1,2]$.",
    "The final answer is: $\\boxed{(2,-1)}$",
    "That's a great solution!\n\nTo confirm, the final answer indeed corresponds to the value $(2,-1)$.\n\nWould you like me to explain or elaborate on this solution? Or perhaps provide some context for this particular problem? I'm here to help!",
    "I think there may have been a misunderstanding. This conversation just started, and I haven't provided a solution yet. I'd be happy to work with you to solve a problem, but I don't have any information to draw from. Could you please provide more context or details about the problem you're trying to solve?",
    "I'm glad we can start fresh. Since this is the beginning of our conversation, there's no problem to work on yet. Let me start by asking: What kind of problem or question are you looking to solve or have answered? Is it related to a personal issue, a technical challenge, a educational topic, or something else?"
